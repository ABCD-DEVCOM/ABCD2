    <p>DNA plasmids encoding foreign proteins may be used as immunogens by direct

    <p>Antibody, helper T lymphocyte, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses have been
    induced in laboratory and domesticated animals by the direct inoculation of DNA plasmids
    encoding foreign proteins, either intramuscularly or by delivery of DNA-coated gold
    particles to the epidermis through biolistic immunization. In a number of animal models,
    immune responses induced by DNA vaccination have been shown to be protective against
    challenge with infectious agents. Immunization by injection of plasmids encoding foreign
    proteins has been used successfully as a research tool. This review summarizes the types
    of DNA vaccine vectors in common use, the immune responses and protective responses that
    have been obtained in animal models, the safety considerations pertinent to the evaluation
    of DNA vaccines in humans and the very limited information that is available from early
    clinical studies.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Construction of DNA vaccine plasmids</b></font></p>
    <p>Plasmids intended to be used as DNA vaccines contain the following essential elements:
    a strong eukaryotic promoter such as the immediate early promoter from cytomegalovirus; a
    gene of interest encoding an antigenic target expressed by a pathogen; a transcription
    terminator such as that from bovine growth hormone; an antibiotic resistance gene or other
    selectable marker to facilitate selection of transformed organisms carrying the plasmid,
    and an origin of replication, to allow for production of the plasmid in the desired host,
    that is not active in mammalian cells. Most commonly, plasmids of this type are produced
    in <i>E. coli</i>, using as a backbone an <i>E. coli</i> plasmid such as pBR322 or pUC18;
    in principle other hosts, e.g., yeasts, also could be used. The combination of the
    essential elements yields a eukaryotic expression vector that is capable of driving the
    production of the antigen of interest in cells of the vaccinated animal, but is unable to
    replicate in this species (1,2).</p>
    <p>It has generally been assumed that DNA vaccines that produce more antigen <i>in situ</i>
    will elicit higher levels of immune responses. Hence, DNA vaccine vectors have been
    developed to maximize the level of antigen expression. In general, strong viral promoters
    such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) have been employed and have
    proven effective in animal models. In systems where tissue-specific expression is desired,
    non-viral promoters may be considered. For example, the albumin promoter was used to
    target expression of antigen in hepatocytes by DNA vaccines, and the immunoglobulin
    promoter and enhancer elements were used to obtain preferential expression in B cells. All
    of the promoters listed above require that the expression vector be transported into the
    nucleus for transcription to take place. This requirement may be avoided by use of a
    bacteriophage T7 promoter system, where expression of the T7 RNA polymerase can drive
    expression of antigen controlled by the T7 promoter without need for host cell
    transcription machinery. This approach may also be useful for expressing proteins that
    require the involvement of other gene products (e.g., rev-dependent expression of HIV
    env).</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Immune responses induced by DNA vaccines</b></font></p>
    <p><b>Humoral immunity</b></p>
    <p>Administration of plasmid DNA has proven to be an effective means of generating humoral
    immune responses against various foreign proteins in laboratory and domesticated animals
    and in some nonhuman primates. Antibody responses were first demonstrated in mice, induced
    by particle bombardment with gold beads coated with DNA encoding human growth hormone and
    human <font FACE="Symbol">a</font>-1 antitrypsin (3). Antibodies against the viral
    influenza proteins nucleoprotein (NP) and hemagglutinin (HA) were demonstrated after <i>im</i>
    injection of DNA vaccines, as well as other antigens such as HIV envelope, bovine herpes
    virus glycoprotein, and hepatitis B surface antigen (2,4-8). Later, DNA vaccines were used
    to immunize animals against an idiotypic antibody of a B-cell lymphoma, carcinoembryonic
    antigen, human Ig V region, MHC class I molecules, rabies virus glycoprotein, herpes
    simplex glycoproteins B and D, HIV rev, papillomavirus L1, hepatitis C virus nucleocapsid,
    hepatitis B core protein, duck hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis D and E virus
    structural proteins, HTLV-1 envelope protein, St. Louis and Russian encephalitis virus
    prM/E, Japanese encephalitis virus NS1, dengue-2 envelope protein, CMV tegument pp65,
    bovine RSV G protein, foot-and-mouth disease virus, <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i>
    paramyosin, <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> circumsporozoite protein, <i>Leishmania major</i>
    gp63, <i>Bacillus thuringensis</i> delta-endotoxin, fragment C of tetanus toxin, <i>Brucella
    abortus</i> ribosomal genes, <i>Mycoplasma pulmonis</i>, and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>
    antigen 85 and hsp65 (9-13). Introduction of plasmid DNA into mucosal surfaces by feeding
    of plasmid encapsulated in microspheres, or by direct application of plasmid with mucosal
    adjuvants or cationic lipids, has been reported to yield secretory immune responses in
    mice. Because DNA vaccination results in the expression of antigen by host cells, proper
    antigenicity of proteins of eukaryotic origin in general, and of viral proteins in
    particular, may be achieved more readily than with other types of vaccines, such as
    inactivated viruses, subunits, or recombinant proteins. Therefore, DNA vaccination is an
    effective way of obtaining humoral immune responses in animals against viral, bacterial,
    parasitic, tumor, and eukaryotic proteins of immunological interest.</p>
    <p>Early studies of antibody responses induced by DNA vaccines in animal models focused on
    viral envelope proteins, such as influenza HA, gD of herpes simplex virus, rabies virus
    glycoprotein, hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), and HIV env, all of which are naturally
    expressed in membrane-anchored form. In the cases of influenza HA, HBsAg, and HIV env, in
    addition to the membrane-anchored form, a soluble form of the mature protein may also be
    generated naturally by enzymatic cleavage or by shedding of virus-like particles. Robust
    antibody responses, including conformationally specific virus-neutralizing antibodies,
    were readily demonstrated using these DNA vaccines. Later studies of DNA vaccines that
    encoded proteins that were not normally targeted for secretion, such as L1 of cottontail
    rabbit papillomavirus, showed that conformationally specific virus-neutralizing antibodies
    could be induced even though the protein product lacked secretion signal sequences. DNA
    vaccines that encode influenza NP also induce strong antibody responses, although the
    protein product lacks a conventional secretion signal sequence and contains a nuclear
    localization signal. DNA vaccines that encode secreted forms of soluble proteins, such as
    human growth hormone, immunoglobulin single-chain Fv's, or an N-terminal fragment of HSV
    gB, have also been shown to be capable of eliciting antibody responses. In contrast, DNA
    vaccines that encode proteins that are degraded intracellularly, e.g., by
    ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, produce strong cellular immunity but generally are
    ineffective or of much reduced effectiveness in inducing antibody responses (14). Thus,
    the ability of a DNA vaccine to produce antibody responses may depend more on its ability
    to produce mature protein in an appropriate conformation than on whether the protein is
    membrane-anchored or soluble, and whether it is targeted for secretion by conventional
    mechanisms. Thus, a reasonable approach to developing DNA vaccines against an unknown
    protein that is not normally secreted would be to express the protein both with and
    without an exogenous secretion signal sequence. For transmembrane proteins, expression of
    both full-length membrane-anchored and truncated soluble forms would be appropriate.</p>
    <p><b>CD4+ T cells</b></p>
    <p>CD4+ &quot;helper&quot; T cells are grouped into functional subsets characterized by
    the particular cytokines they produce. In mice, type 1-like helper (Th1) T cells
    predominantly produce the cytokines IL-2 and <font FACE="Symbol">g</font>-interferon and
    support the development of cellular immune responses, including DTH (delayed-type
    hypersensitivity) and CTL, and antibody responses of the IgG2a immunoglobulin isotype.
    Type 2-like helper (Th2) T cells may produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10, and promote B
    cell activation and immunoglobulin class switching. In mice, antibody responses driven by
    Th1-type T cells are predominantly of the IgG2a immunoglobulin isotype, while responses
    driven by Th2-type T cells are typified by a predominance of the IgG1 isotype.
    Intramuscular immunization of mice with DNA encoding a variety of antigens, such as
    influenza HA and NP, HIV env, gag, and rev, and <i>M. tuberculosis</i> antigen 85,
    generates memory T lymphocyte responses (9). These have been identified both by
    antigen-specific T cell proliferation and by cytokine secretion during culture of
    splenocytes from vaccinated animals. Supernatants from antigen-stimulated cultures
    contained high levels of IL-2 and <font FACE="Symbol">g</font>-interferon with little or
    no IL-4 or IL-5, indicating that intramuscular DNA vaccination elicited Th1-like cytokine
    responses. In the studies of NP and env, selective removal of lymphocyte populations
    indicated that CD4+ T lymphocytes were the primary responding cells in these assays. In
    contrast, vaccination by gene gun, which delivers DNA primarily to the epidermis, can lead
    to mixed-phenotype or Th2-like responses. It may be that the adjuvant effects of plasmid
    DNA tend to preferentially drive Th1 type responses in a dose-dependent manner; thus,
    intramuscular immunization, since it uses higher doses of DNA, may tend to preferentially
    activate Th1 cells.</p>
    <p><b>CD8+ T cells</b></p>
    <p>CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize peptides 8-10 amino acids in length that are
    displayed on the cell surface bound to MHC class I molecules. In general the peptides are
    generated in the cytosol by the action of the proteosome, the transporter of antigen
    peptide (TAP) gene products, or signal peptidase, and then transported to the endoplasmic
    reticulum where they bind to nascent MHC class I molecules. CD8+ CTL are present in lymph
    nodes and spleens of mice that have been injected intramuscularly with plasmid DNA
    encoding viral antigens, and can be demonstrated upon restimulation <i>in vitro</i> with
    antigen, or with mitogen and IL-2, or, in the case of LCMV, restimulation <i>in vivo</i>
    by viral infection. Effector CTL that recognized epitopes presented by class I molecules
    have been demonstrated in mice immunized with DNA encoding the NP from influenza A virus,
    HBsAg and core antigen, and HIV env (2,9,11). CTL that were capable of recognizing and
    killing virus-infected targets have been induced in mice by DNA vaccines against influenza
    virus, against HIV (demonstrated using targets infected with vaccinia-HIVgp160
    recombinants), against vaccinia virus or adenovirus-rabies virus glycoprotein
    recombinants, against LCMV, against HSV, and against measles virus. In studies of
    influenza NP in BALB/c mice, a single intramuscular injection of as little as 1 µg of NP
    DNA induced CTL that recognized the 147-155 epitope peptide from influenza NP. Higher
    doses of NP DNA yielded CTL precursors at progressively increasing frequencies. Anti-NP
    CTL induced by <i>im</i> injection of influenza NP DNA were found to persist for more than
    two years. Subsequent <i>im</i> immunization and boosting with DNA vaccines increased
    cell-mediated immune responses to influenza NP and also to HIV env. Multiple <i>im</i>
    immunizations have been reported to drive immune responses toward a Th1 phenotype. In
    rhesus monkeys injected intramuscularly with DNA vaccines encoding either HIV env or gag
    genes, MHC class I-restricted, antigen-specific CTL developed following one or two
    vaccinations. Anti-env CTL were detected at least 11 months (the longest time point
    tested) following a final injection demonstrating that these responses can be long-lived
    (11).</p>
    <p>Induction of CTL responses after gene gun immunization was first demonstrated using the
    gene for the MHC antigen H-2K<sup>b </sup>administered directly into surgically exposed
    spleen and muscle. Mice immunized by these routes developed allospecific CTL. Studies of
    epidermal gene gun immunization in mice showed that 3 epidermal gene gun immunizations of
    4 µg each of a construct encoding HIV gp120 and 1 µg each of a construct encoding HIV
    rev induced CTL responses that were detected after 2 immunizations but appeared to be
    suppressed by a third immunization, while antibody responses appeared after dose 3. This
    result may have been associated with a switch in helper T cell phenotypes from Th1 to Th2,
    as the loss of CTL responsiveness was blocked by administration of antibody to IL-4. In
    rhesus monkeys, gene gun immunization using plasmids encoding SIV env and gag genes
    induced env-specific CTL in 3/3 monkeys, although gag-specific CTL were not detected.
    Intramuscular and intravenous injections of the same plasmids combined with gene gun
    immunization yielded env-specific CTL in 3/3 animals and gag-specific CTL in 2/3
    animals(15).</p>
    <p>Recent interest has focused on the potential mechanisms by which DNA vaccines induce
    CTL responses. The intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA transfects predominantly
    striated muscle cells, while epidermal immunization by gene gun may transfect epidermal
    keratinocytes and Langerhans cells, and also mononuclear cells present in epidermal
    capillary beds. Transplantation of C2C12 myoblasts stably transfected with the gene for
    influenza NP yielded NP-specific CTL responses, indicating that direct transfection of
    antigen-presenting cells (APC) is not required for the induction of CTL by DNA vaccines
    (16). However, studies in several laboratories have shown that bone marrow-derived APC are
    required for the induction of CTL by DNA vaccines administered intramuscularly, or
    epidermally by gene gun (17). Studies in our laboratory have shown that APC are required
    even when the NP protein is delivered by transplantation of stably transfected myoblast
    lines (16). Thus, the induction of CTL responses by DNA vaccines may occur, at least in
    part, by transfer of antigen from non-APC to APC (termed &quot;cross-priming&quot;). DNA
    vaccines consisting of plasmids encoding proteins targeted for intracellular degradation,
    or minigenes encoding minimal epitopes, are still capable of inducing CTL, and thus in the
    case of DNA vaccines cross-priming may occur by transfer of processed peptide as well as
    of the mature protein. Bone marrow-derived APC, such as dendritic cells, are potent
    inducers of CTL, and thus direct transfection of APC may also play an important role, e.g.
    in gene gun immunization.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Protective immune responses in animal models</b></font></p>
    <p>Influenza was the first disease for which protective immunity induced by DNA vaccines
    was demonstrated in animal models. Cross-strain protection, in which mice immunized
    against one influenza subtype were rendered resistant to challenge by a different subtype,
    was induced by immunization with DNA encoding NP (2). In this system protection was
    obtained even though the immunizing antigen was taken from an influenza strain that arose
    34 years before the challenge strain, and was of a different subtype. This illustrates the
    potential of CTL responses to provide broad cross-protection when highly conserved
    epitopes are targeted. Protective responses against homologous influenza strains were
    demonstrated in mice, chickens (5), and ferrets using DNA encoding HA. In ferrets,
    immunization with a combination of DNA plasmids encoding HA and two internal conserved
    proteins, NP and matrix, provided protection from an antigenically distinct isolate of
    influenza, as measured by a decrease in nasal viral shedding that was equivalent to
    protection provided by DNA encoding the homologous HA (4). Protective immune responses
    have been demonstrated in a number of other preclinical animal models including human
    immunodeficiency virus (LCMV) (18), bovine herpes virus, a murine and a mucosal guinea pig
    model of human herpes simplex virus, rabies virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus,
    cottontail rabbit papilloma virus, hepatitis B virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus,
    Japanese encephalitis virus, Russian spring/summer encephalitis virus, Central European
    encephalitis virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus (9). While in most of the models
    immunity was dependent upon the generation of protective antibody responses, for LCMV and
    for the influenza studies with NP DNA the protection seen was based upon cellular
    responses.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Safety considerations for use of DNA vaccines in humans</b></font></p>
    <p>Regulatory agencies charged with reviewing applications for the study of experimental
    DNA vaccines in humans have published &quot;Points to Consider&quot; documents that
    emphasize the following areas: potential integration of the plasmid DNA into the host cell
    genome; potential induction of autoimmunity or of immune tolerance, and potential
    induction of pathogenic anti-DNA antibodies.</p>
    <p><b>Potential for integration</b></p>
    <p>The integration of injected plasmid DNA into the genome of a living animal, if it
    occurred, might have no biological effect. Alternatively, such integration might
    potentially be mutagenic, if the integration event disrupted a cellular gene. In an
    extreme situation, integration might be carcinogenic, if the integration event were to
    inactivate a cell cycle regulatory gene or activate an oncogene. Integration by homologous
    recombination works most efficiently when both DNA copies are being replicated, and
    significant homology exists over a range of 600 base pairs. In the case of intramuscular
    DNA vaccination, the probability of integration appears to be very low. The plasmids
    commonly used for DNA vaccination do not contain an origin of replication that is
    functional in eukaryotic cells, the cells thought to be transfected (myocytes) are for the
    most part nondividing, and the plasmids used contain only very limited sequence homology
    with mammalian DNA. Studies of integration with sensitive PCR methods (1 copy/150,000
    nuclei, which has been calculated to be 3 orders of magnitude less than the spontaneous
    mutation rate) in mice injected intramuscularly with plasmid DNA encoding influenza NP
    have not detected integration of the injected plasmid thus far (19).</p>
    <p><b>Potential for induction of immunologic tolerance and autoimmunity</b></p>
    <p>Since the amount of antigen produced after DNA immunization may be small, and since
    administration of small quantities of haptens or protein antigens can induce
    unresponsiveness, the formal possibility exists that antigen-specific unresponsiveness
    rather than protective immunity might be induced by DNA vaccines. However, many studies
    have demonstrated the ability of DNA vaccination to induce functional immune responses.
    Even in neonatal mice, injection of DNA vaccines may induce immunologic priming rather
    than unresponsiveness, depending upon the experimental system used (20). Autoimmune
    responses might be induced if the immune response to the encoded antigen results in
    immune-mediated destruction of the host cells expressing the antigen genes (21). However,
    the destruction of tissue cells occurs in normal processes of tissue remodeling as well as
    in the course of viral and bacterial infections. So far there is little evidence that DNA
    vaccines pose a greater risk in this regard than conventional viral or bacterial vaccines.</p>
    <p><b>Potential for induction of anti-DNA antibodies</b></p>
    <p>A third safety consideration concerns the potential for induction of pathogenic immune
    responses directed initially against the plasmid DNA itself. Although pathogenic anti-DNA
    antibodies are generally believed to be a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
    many other factors such as genetic susceptibility and underlying immune dysfunction play a
    role in these disease processes. It is not clear whether exposure to bacterial DNA can
    induce or exacerbate SLE in humans. Surprisingly, inoculation of spontaneously autoimmune
    mice with bacterial DNA can in some instances reduce the severity of their disease
    (22,23). Although the likelihood of induction of pathogenic anti-DNA antibodies by
    vaccination with plasmid DNA needs to be considered carefully, studies in laboratory
    animals have shown that purified dsDNA does not readily induce anti-DNA antibodies. To
    induce anti-dsDNA antibodies in normal mice it is necessary to inoculate them with DNA
    that has been denatured, complexed with methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) and
    coadministered with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Injection of mice with dsDNA,
    regardless of origin, is not effective in inducing anti-DNA antibodies as measured by
    ELISA, immunoblot or radioimmunoassay (9). It is not yet known whether DNA vaccines will
    induce anti-DNA antibodies in humans.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Phase I human clinical trials</b></font></p>
    <p>Clinical studies of DNA vaccines are still in very early stages. Phase I studies are
    ongoing in B cell lymphoma, HIV, influenza, malaria, herpes simplex, hepatitis B, and
    melanoma. Little has been published to date but generally the vaccines appear to be well
    tolerated. Cell-mediated immune responses, including CTL, have been described in clinical
    studies of HIV (24) and malaria DNA vaccines (25). Antibody responses have been less
    widely reported. Some clinical responses (i.e., shrinkage of tumors) have been reported in
    studies of intratumoral injection of a plasmid encoding HLA-B7 formulated in cationic
    lipids. Further information on the dose range required to induce immune responses, the
    usefulness of various adjuvants and excipients, and the magnitude and duration of the
    resulting immune responses will be needed to assess the potential utility of DNA vaccines
    in humans.</p>
