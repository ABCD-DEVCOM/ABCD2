    <p>Eric Newsholme's laboratory was the first to show glutamine utilization by lymphocytes
    and macrophages. Recently, we have found that neutrophils also utilize glutamine. This
    amino acid has been shown to play a role in lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production
    by lymphocytes and macrophages and phagocytosis and superoxide production by macrophages
    and neutrophils. Knowledge of the metabolic fate of glutamine in these cells is important
    for the understanding of the role and function of this amino acid in the maintenance of
    the proliferative, phagocytic and secretory capacities of these cells. Glutamine and
    glucose are poorly oxidized by these cells and might produce important precursors for DNA,
    RNA, protein and lipid synthesis. The high rate of glutamine utilization and its
    importance in such cells have raised the question as to the source of this glutamine,
    which, according to current evidence, appears to be muscle.</p>

    <p>Lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils play an important role in the immune and
    inflammatory response. Mature lymphocytes recirculate via blood and lymph through lymphoid
    tissues in a relatively quiescent state until stimulated to proliferate during, for
    example, a bacterial or viral infection. In contrast, macrophages are terminally
    differentiated end-cells whose ability to proliferate is gradually lost. Neutrophils
    constitute 60% of the circulating leukocytes. They act as first-line-of-defense cells in
    plasma and perform phagocytosis either alone or in cooperation with antigen-specific
    defenses.</p>
    <p>In recent years, the molecular biology of these cells and the process of chemical
    communication between them have attracted considerable interest and much progress has been
    made in the understanding of some aspects of the immune system. This system is of
    fundamental importance not only in preventing or limiting infection, but also in the
    overall process of repair and recovery from injury. It is therefore important in clinical
    conditions of trauma, sepsis, burns and recovery from surgery (1,2). The significance of
    the cellular immune system in overcoming infection has been recently highlighted by the
    high mortality rate associated with simple immune challenges in acquired immune deficiency
    syndrome. But the immune system may also play a role in the prevention of cancer by being
    able to detect abnormal cells. This is the hypothesis of immunosurveillance. Furthermore,
    selective heightened activity of the immune system may explain a number of pathological
    conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus type I, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid
    arthritis, and ulcerative colitis) - usually defined by the general term autoimmunity.</p>
    <p>Despite the undoubted importance of the cells of the immune system, it is surprising
    that, until recently, relatively little was known about their metabolism, the fuels they
    require to carry out their functions, the rates of utilization and fates of the fuels used
    and any implications for the overall metabolic homeostasis of the animal.</p>
    <p>Indeed, it was not until the pioneering work of Eric Newsholme's laboratory in the
    1980's that it was established that immune cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages could
    utilize glutamine at high rates in addition to glucose (3,4). It was generally thought at
    that time that glutamine was only a quantitatively important fuel for cells of the
    intestine and liver, and tumor cells (5). A recent study from our laboratory has shown
    that neutrophils also utilize glutamine at high rates (6). The metabolic fate of glutamine
    in lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils will be discussed in the present paper.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Metabolism in isolated cells</b></font></p>
    <p>The question arises how is it possible to obtain, initially and relatively quickly,
    information on the metabolic properties of cells or tissues that are metabolically
    uncharacterized. One means of obtaining this information is from <i>in vitro</i> catalytic
    activities of a variety of enzymes. A comparison of activities within the tissue and
    between different tissues permits the determination of the preliminary characteristics of
    the metabolism. These can then be tested or investigated by studying flux within the
    pathways. But which enzymes should be studied? The maximum <i>in vitro</i> catalytic
    activities of certain key enzymes in different pathways can provide information on the
    maximal capacities of certain pathways in metabolism. The quantitative value of the
    approach depends upon the care with which the enzymes are chosen. They must function only
    in the pathway being assessed and must catalyze non-equilibrium reactions. It should be
    emphasized that maximum enzyme activities indicate only the maximum potential for the
    utilization of a particular fuel and cannot determine whether a fuel is actually used in a
    given situation (5).</p>
    <p>The maximal catalytic activities of some key enzymes in the metabolism of rat
    lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils are given in <a HREF="3237t01.gif">Table 1</a>.
    These activities indicate the possibility that these cells are able to utilize glucose and
    glutamine. They also suggest that their capacity for the utilization of glucose and
    glutamine is very high. The rates of utilization of glucose and glutamine and of oxidation
    of these compounds by the isolated and incubated cells are given in <a HREF="3237t02.gif">Table
    2</a>. Furthermore, on the basis of rates of glucose and glutamine utilization, the rate
    of end-product formation from these compounds, and glutaminase activity, it appears that,
    of the glucose and glutamine utilized by these cells, very little is oxidized via
    acetyl-CoA and the classic citric acid cycle. Glucose is converted almost totally into
    lactate and glutamine into glutamate, aspartate and lactate (<a HREF="3237t02.gif">Table 2</a>);
    for full details of these findings see references 6,7,8.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Role of glutamine in immune function</b></font></p>
    <p>In conditions in which the immune response is impaired such as aging (9) and
    malnutrition (10) there is a marked change in the activity of phosphate-dependent
    glutaminase, a key enzyme of glutamine metabolism. Mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes
    increases both glutaminase activity and the rate of glutamine utilization (11). In the
    absence of glutamine, lymphocytes do not proliferate <i>in vitro</i>; proliferation
    increases greatly with glutamine concentration (12). The presence of Walker 256 tumor in
    rats promotes an increase in the activity of glutaminase in the lymphoid organs and
    isolated lymphocytes and macrophages (13). Glutamine utilization has also been shown to be
    associated with the production of superoxide and interleukin-1 and -6 (14) by macrophages
    and interleukin-2 by lymphocytes (15). Macrophage-mediated phagocytosis is influenced by
    glutamine availability (11). Beneficial effects of the provision of glutamine (16) or its
    precursors (17) have been reported in patients submitted to surgery, radiation treatment
    or bone marrow transplantation or suffering from injury, sepsis or burns (18).</p>
    <p>The mechanism by which glutamine can act to allow high rates of secretory product
    formation and release must account for the diverse nature of these secretory products. In
    the formation of the superoxide, NADPH is required by the enzyme responsible for free
    radical production NADPH oxidase. Glutamine, via catabolic metabolism involving NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent
    malate dehydrogenase (19), can thus generate considerable NADPH for cell requirements.
    Glucose may also, via metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway, generate NADPH.
    However, during periods of active pinocytosis and phagocytosis, glucose and glutamine
    carbon may be diverted toward lipid synthesis, by generating pyruvate (as described later
    in this review) and therefore the pentose-phosphate pathway may be compromised (19).
    Additionally, glutamine carbon may be used for new amino acid synthesis in periods of
    active synthesis and secretion of protein molecules such as cytokines (14,15).</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Fate of glutamine utilization by lymphocytes, macrophages and
    neutrophils</b></font></p>
    <p>It was generally believed that lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils obtain most of
    their energy by metabolism and oxidation of glucose and that lymphocytes, which had not
    been subjected to an immune response (resting lymphocytes), were metabolically quiescent.
    Evidence has recently been obtained that the rate of glutamine utilization by these cells
    is either similar to or greater than that of glucose, that neither glutamine nor glucose
    is oxidized fully (almost all of the glucose used is converted to lactate and almost all
    of the glutamine to glutamate, lactate and aspartate - <a HREF="3237t02.gif">Table 2</a>).
    A high rate of glutamine utilization, but only partial oxidation, is characteristic of
    other cells (e.g. enterocytes, thymocytes, colonocytes, fibroblasts, and tumor cells)
    (20); that the pathway of glutamine oxidation is partial has been known in tumor cells for
    some time and the process was termed glutaminolysis by McKeehan (21). On the basis of
    end-products of metabolism (<a HREF="3237t02.gif">Table 2</a>) and maximal activities of
    some enzymes (<a HREF="3237t01.gif">Table 1</a>), it is probable that glutamine is
    utilized by a similar if not identical pathway in macrophages, lymphocytes and
    neutrophils.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>The role of high rates of glutaminolysis (and glycolysis) in
    lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils</b></font></p>
    <p>For many years, the question of the advantage of a high rate of glycolysis in tumor
    cells has been discussed (see reference 22). A similar question can be raised about
    glutaminolysis. The present work demonstrates that similar metabolic characteristics apply
    to cells of the immune system despite the fact that the cell biology of these cells is
    different: the lymphocytes under study are not rapidly dividing, but possess the potential
    for cell division, the macrophages are terminally differentiated, and the neutrophils have
    a life span of approximately 10 h. Hence any hypothesis must explain high rates of fuel
    utilization in cells with widely different characteristics. Furthermore, the quantitative
    results on lymphocytes and macrophages reported by the authors (see <a HREF="3237t01.gif">Tables
    1</a> and <a HREF="3237t02.gif">2</a>) provide the basis for criticism of previous
    hypotheses. For example, it has been pointed out that both processes provide metabolic
    intermediates for biosynthetic pathways (glycolysis provides glucose 6-phosphate for
    formation of ribose 5-phosphate and for DNA and RNA synthesis, and glycerol 3-phosphate
    for phospholipid synthesis, and glutaminolysis provides ammonia and aspartate for purines
    and pyrimidines for DNA and RNA synthesis). While this is true, the rates of both
    glycolysis and glutaminolysis - at least in lymphocytes - are greatly in excess
    (&gt;100-fold) of the requirements for these biosynthetic processes. Another suggestion is
    that these processes provide energy for the cell: in fact, energy provision is considered
    to be a major role of glutaminolysis in tumor cells and enterocytes (23). While the
    capacity for rapid cell division is retained by isolated lymphocytes this does not apply
    to isolated neutrophils or macrophages which are terminally differentiated cells with
    little capacity for cell division. However, neutrophils and macrophages have a large
    phagocytic capacity (requiring a high rate of lipid turnover and synthesis) and secretory
    activity (19).</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Pyruvate metabolism in lymphocytes and macrophages</b></font></p>
    <p>Pyruvate is a common product of both glycolysis and glutaminolysis and represents a key
    substrate for full oxidation of glucose and glutamine through the Krebs cycle (7). Since
    lymphocytes and macrophages utilize glucose and glutamine at high rates but present a low
    rate of their oxidation, the metabolic fate of pyruvate was then examined.</p>
    <p>Lymphocytes and macrophages possess both pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate
    carboxylase activities. Studies using [1-<sup>14</sup>C]- and [3-<sup>14</sup>C]-pyruvate
    have shown that the rate of incorporation of [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-pyruvate into <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>
    by either incubated cells or isolated mitochondria is high, in comparison with the rate of
    conversion of [3-<sup>14</sup>C]-pyruvate to <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> which is very
    low. In cells, the rate of conversion of [3-<sup>14</sup>C]-pyruvate to <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>
    is only 6-15% that of [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-pyruvate conversion to <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>,
    whereas in isolated mitochondria this ratio is only about 4% (22). These findings suggest
    that acetyl-CoA produced via the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction is not oxidatively
    decarboxylated by the reactions of the Krebs cycle in lymphocytes and macrophages.
    Therefore, the fate of acetyl-CoA derived from pyruvate was then investigated. The maximum
    catalytic activities of the following enzymes of citrate and acetyl-CoA metabolism were
    then measured in lymphocytes: citrate synthase, ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA hydrolase,
    acetylcarnitine transferase, HMG-CoA lyase, HMG-CoA synthase, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase,
    3-oxoacid-CoA transferase, and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. The quantitative
    contribution of pyruvate to CO<sub>2</sub>, lactate, aspartate, alanine, citrate,
    acetyl-CoA and ketone bodies accounted for the pyruvate metabolized (24). Acetyl-CoA was
    converted to acetoacetate by reactions which may favor the pathway catalyzed by
    acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and 3-oxoacid-CoA transferase. The authors concluded that
    pyruvate from glucose or glutamine metabolism is directed <i>inter alia</i> at the
    formation of acetoacetate which may serve as a lipid synthesis precursor. In fact, our
    previous studies have established that glutamine is an important precursor of lipid
    synthesis in adipocytes (25).</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Lipid synthesis from pyruvate in lymphocytes and macrophages</b></font></p>
    <p>Only very small amounts of either pyruvate or acetate are incorporated into lipids in
    90-min incubated resting mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes (24). The amounts of [3-<sup>14</sup>C]-pyruvate
    and [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate incorporated were partitioned, respectively, as follows:
    14.8 and 16.3% for free fatty acids, 4.2 and 8.1% for triglycerides, 78.4 and 74.7% for
    cholesterol, and 2.6 and 0.9% for cholesterol ester. When pyruvate utilization and
    metabolism were enhanced by concanavalin A (Con A), then acetoacetate formation was not
    favored and from this it was proposed that acetyl units may then be directed to lipid
    synthesis and may also make a contribution to the energy metabolism of activated
    lymphocytes.</p>
    <p>To further investigate the importance of pyruvate as lipid precursor, lymphocytes and
    macrophages were cultured for 24 h. Under this condition, lymphocytes actively synthesize
    lipids from [3-<sup>14</sup>C]-pyruvate (26,27). Experiments with [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate
    as a lipid precursor showed a close similarity with the rates of incorporation of [3-<sup>14</sup>C]-pyruvate
    into the same lipid fractions. Treatment of lymphocytes with Con A (T cell mitogen)
    markedly enhanced [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate incorporation into a variety of lipids, but
    the lectin did not affect [3-<sup>14</sup>C]-pyruvate incorporation. The results suggest
    that lymphocytes convert pyruvate into lipids via the acetyl-CoA pathway and that Con A
    interferes with lymphocyte lipogenesis but does not seem to affect the pyruvate
    dehydrogenase reaction. The ability to incorporate pyruvate into certain lipids may have
    an important role for the rapidly dividing capacity of lymphocytes since the human cancer
    strain HeLa 155 (a quickly proliferating cell line) also exhibits this feature by
    converting much more [3-<sup>14</sup>C]-pyruvate into lipids than do lymphocytes. In
    addition, peritoneal macrophages (non-proliferating cells) present a still higher capacity
    for conversion of pyruvate into lipids. Therefore, the role of pyruvate in lipid synthesis
    is not restricted to rapidly proliferating cells only. Macrophages present a very high
    turnover of lipids in the membrane and so lipid synthesis might be required to keep the
    cell membrane integrity and function.</p>
    <p>Several studies have demonstrated that lipids actively regulate immune cell function
    (25). This effect might occur at least partially due to changes in glucose and glutamine
    metabolism of these cells (25). These findings support the proposition that glutamine
    could be a precursor for lipid synthesis in these cells, which in turn might play a role
    for the function of lymphocyte and macrophage.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Importance of the metabolic fate of glutamine for the immune cell
    function</b></font></p>
    <p>As the rate of utilization of glutamine exceeds that required by biosynthetic purposes,
    an explanation is required for the observed high rates of utilization. Application of the
    quantitative theory of metabolic control to branched pathways provides a hypothesis that
    accounts for the high rate of both glycolysis and glutaminolysis in all cells discussed
    above, i.e., rapidly dividing cells (e.g. tumor cells), those with the potential for cell
    division (e.g. lymphocytes, some enterocytes, endothelial cells) and terminally
    differentiated cells such as macrophages, some enterocytes, colonocytes, and neutrophils.</p>
    <p>High rates of glycolysis and glutaminolysis provide precursors for biosynthetic
    pathways, but the fluxes through these biosynthetic pathways are normally very small in
    comparison to the fluxes through glycolysis and glutaminolysis. However, the flux through
    the biosynthetic pathways will increase considerably during the synthesis of DNA, RNA,
    proteins (such as cytokines) and also lipids (such as phospholipids, cholesterol, and
    triacylglycerol) for new cell membranes (28). Also the stimulation of the respiratory
    burst by specific factors demands a substantial increase in the formation of reducing
    power (NADPH and NADH) for superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production. Since these
    intermediates play a role in the immune cell function, the provision of glutamine
    represents an important regulatory factor of their function (29). Therefore, it is
    important to appreciate that the source of glutamine for use by these cells is the muscle.
    In fact, glutamine content of skeletal muscle is reduced under intense catabolic
    conditions such as cancer cachexia (30), a fact that may reflect intense demand for
    glutamine by cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages. Therefore, muscle amino acid
    metabolism is indirectly linked to the capacity of immune cells to respond appropriately
    to a stimulus (31).</p>
