    <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a pollutant commonly recognized for its toxicological
    attributes, including CNS and cardiovascular effects. But CO is also formed endogenously
    in mammalian tissues. Endogenously formed CO normally arises from heme degradation in a
    reaction catalyzed by heme oxygenase. While inhibitors of endogenous CO production can
    raise arterial pressure, heme loading can enhance CO production and lead to
    vasodepression. Both central and peripheral tissues possess heme oxygenases and generate
    CO from heme, but the inability of heme substrate to cross the blood brain barrier
    suggests the CNS heme-heme oxygenase-CO system may be independent of the periphery. In the
    CNS, CO apparently acts in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) promoting changes in
    glutamatergic neurotransmission and lowering blood pressure. At the periphery, the
    heme-heme oxygenase-CO system can affect cardiovascular functions in a two-fold manner;
    specifically: 1) heme-derived CO generated within vascular smooth muscle (VSM) can promote
    vasodilation, but 2) its actions on the endothelium apparently can promote
    vasoconstriction. Thus, it seems reasonable that the CNS-, VSM- and endothelial-dependent
    actions of the heme-heme oxygenase-CO system may all affect cardiac output and vascular
    resistance, and subsequently blood pressure.</p>

    <p>Carbon monoxide is readily recognized for its toxic effects. Its colorless and odorless
    properties, combined with its tenacious ability to compete with oxygen for binding to
    hemoglobin, can lull its victims into a gradual unnoticed somnolence and vasodepression
    which all too often are fatal. Less appreciated is the tendency for long periods of low
    level carbon monoxide exposure to promote neural pathologies and elicit changes in
    cardiovascular functions (1,2).</p>
    <p>Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin and a minimum of 0.5-1% carboxyhemoglobin is
    inevitably detected in most mammalian species. While initially thought to be a
    manifestation of widespread environmental contamination, it was eventually realized that
    these persistent carboxyhemoglobin levels arise from carbon monoxide which is formed
    within the host. This endogenously formed carbon monoxide arises primarily as a product of
    heme metabolism (3). Until recently, endogenously formed carbon monoxide was regarded
    simply as a waste product, but there is now a growing awareness that even endogenously
    formed carbon monoxide may influence biological functions&nbsp;(4).</p>
    <p>While much has been learned about the toxicological actions of carbon monoxide and
    about the biochemistry related to endogenous carbon monoxide formation, only recent
    studies have tried to functionally link these two areas. The purpose of this review is to
    highlight some of the important physical properties and the biochemical actions of carbon
    monoxide, to review some of the tools used to investigate the endogenous carbon monoxide
    system, and to summarize the apparent acute effects of this system as they relate to
    cardiovascular functions.</p>
    <p>The toxicological aspects of carbon monoxide have been studied for decades. Diverse
    models of distribution kinetics, the performance of dose-time related actions, and the
    identification of multiple organ involvement are evidence that the actions of carbon
    monoxide can be quite complex (5). While the critical details of the toxicological actions
    of carbon monoxide are admittedly well beyond the scope of the current review,
    comprehensive works on the biochemical and cardiovascular effects of carbon monoxide
    intoxication have been published elsewhere (1,2,5,6). Since the toxicology literature
    serves as a basis for many of the known actions of carbon monoxide, a few features culled
    from those studies should still be mentioned to appreciate some of the potential actions
    of endogenously formed carbon monoxide on biological processes.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Messenger systems</b></font></p>
    <p>Heme proteins are often identified by their tendency to bind carbon monoxide (7). For
    heme proteins possessing enzymatic properties, the binding of carbon monoxide is often
    accompanied by changes in their metabolic activities (7-10). Accordingly, any or all heme
    proteins would seem particularly well suited to be potentially involved in the biological
    actions of carbon monoxide.</p>
    <p>Soluble guanylate cyclase is a commonly considered candidate (4,8). Carbon monoxide
    activates purified soluble guanylate cyclase to increase cGMP formation approximately
    two-fold, which is relatively modest when compared to the 100-fold greater increases that
    may be obtained by activation with nitric oxide (8). However, such differences in efficacy
    do not preclude the possibility that functional effects may still arise from the increases
    in cGMP production which can be attained from carbon monoxide-induced activation of
    soluble guanylate cyclase.</p>
    <p>Carbon monoxide was shown to dilate vascular smooth muscle preparations in a manner
    which was prevented by methylene blue, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase (11).
    Consequently, it was suggested that carbon monoxide-induced vasodilation of vascular
    smooth muscle was soluble guanylate cyclase-dependent. But recent studies employing newly
    developed inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase have shown that carbon monoxide-induced
    dilation may proceed even when soluble guanylate cyclase activity has been blocked
    (12,13). These findings suggest that carbon monoxide, at least under some conditions, may
    promote relaxation of vascular smooth muscle by processes which are soluble guanylate
    cyclase-independent.</p>
    <p>The cytochrome P450 family of enzymes (cytP450), which collectively display a spectral
    shift in response to carbon monoxide binding, are another class of enzymes proposed as
    potential mediators of carbon monoxide-induced effects (7). However, it has been suggested
    that the CO/O<sub>2</sub> ratio required to produce significant binding to most types of
    cytP450 enzymes would also be likely to overwhelm the O<sub>2</sub>-carrying capacity of
    circulating hemoglobin to a fatal extent (2,5).</p>
    <p>In contrast to other P450 enzymes, the activities of some mitochondrial cytochrome
    oxidases may be affected by levels of carbon monoxide which fall short of producing fatal
    hypoxia (5). Also, the binding of carbon monoxide to these cytochrome oxidases is
    apparently further enhanced during increased metabolic demand and in environments of
    reduced oxygen tensions. As these cytochromes of the mitochondrial membrane are involved
    in electron transport and in the generation of ATP, disruption of the associated electron
    shuttling may in turn lead to multiple functional effects by interfering with kinase- and
    other ATP-dependent processes.</p>
    <p>Prostaglandin G/H<sub> </sub>synthase (14), catalases (15), and potassium channels (16)
    are also amongst the suggested potential targets for the actions of carbon monoxide. In
    addition, cyclooxygenase-2 has recently been recognized to be heme-bearing (17), and thus
    may also participate in the biological actions of carbon monoxide. The relative
    contributions of each of these systems to the biological effects of carbon monoxide, if
    any, have yet to be fully understood.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Endogenous sources of carbon monoxide and their regulation</b></font></p>
    <p>Endogenously formed carbon monoxide arises primarily from the degradation of monomeric
    free heme and is generated in a reaction catalyzed by the heme oxygenases. During this
    reaction heme is degraded to release equimolar quantities of iron, biliverdin and carbon
    monoxide (3). The iron is primarily recycled into the formation of new heme while the
    biliverdin is rapidly converted to bilirubin by an abundance of biliverdin reductases
    (18). The carbon monoxide product eventually binds to circulating hemoglobin and is then
    transported as carboxyhemoglobin until it is excreted through ventilation. Heme oxygenase
    activity in some tissue homogenates is sufficient to generate 2 nmol of carbon monoxide/mg
    protein per hour (19). Given that 1% carboxyhemoglobin levels in the blood are quite
    common, this constitutes a minimum load of approximately 100 µmol/l carbon monoxide
    trapped within the vascular space.</p>
    <p>Normally, endogenously formed carbon monoxide arises almost exclusively from the
    metabolism of heme by heme oxygenase. At least three isoforms of heme oxygenase have been
    identified (3,20) which originate from multiple mRNAs (21,22). Some heavy metals,
    metalloporphyrins, as well as heme, have been shown to chronically induce heme oxygenase-1
    while having relatively little effect on the expression of heme oxygenase-2 (21). Very
    little is known about the recently discovered heme oxygenase-3 isoform (20). The
    regulation of heme oxygenase expression is quite complex (21), but it is clear that the
    induction of heme oxygenase in some tissues may allow them to participate in the local
    generation of carbon monoxide where they otherwise might be limited by a deficiency of the
    mediating enzyme.</p>
    <p>Increased expression of heme oxygenase protein is not the only means for stimulating
    the generation of carbon monoxide and other heme oxygenase products. Alternatively, heme
    loading can rapidly increase plasma bilirubin (23) in a manner which precedes discernable
    induction of the enzyme. Since the provision of the substrate rapidly increases the
    generation of heme oxygenase products, it is clear that heme availability can be a
    rate-limiting step for the endogenous production of carbon monoxide.</p>
    <p>Biochemical evidence derived from studies of delta aminolevulinic acid (dALA) synthase
    and its feedback inhibition by heme (24) imply that normal resting levels of free heme may
    be in the vicinity of 0.5-1.0 µmol/l. Oddly, heme loading in 50-fold excess of these
    levels typically increases plasma bilirubin levels and CO production by only 2-3-fold
    (23). The reason for these divergent trends may be related to the physical properties of
    heme. In aqueous solutions at physiological pH, monomeric free heme has been characterized
    as reaching saturation at around 2 µmol/l (25). Heme which is loaded beyond this limit
    progressively forms dimeric structures and polymeric chains (25). While these
    dimeric/polymeric forms may potentially constitute &quot;heme stores&quot;, they
    apparently do not function as substrates for heme oxygenase (3,26). Consequently, it can
    make sense that heme loading might only double or triple the concentration of monomeric
    free heme in tissues. In turn, this increase in heme oxygenase substrate availability
    should be paralleled by increases in carbon monoxide/bilirubin formation (23).</p>
    <p>Endogenously formed carbon monoxide does not arise solely from the degradation of heme.
    In fact, inhibition of heme oxygenase activity reduces carbon monoxide production by only
    30-50% at best (27). While heme degradation is usually the primary source of endogenously
    formed carbon monoxide, the blockade of heme oxygenase activity initiates the generation
    of carbon monoxide from alternative sources including a process involved in fatty acid
    metabolism (27,28). The mechanisms underlying these shifts in carbon monoxide sources are
    poorly understood.</p>
    <p>The suggestion that endogenously formed carbon monoxide might participate in biological
    functions was highlighted in a seminal work by Gerald Marks (4). Noting that carbon
    monoxide is an activator of soluble guanylate cyclase, and that carbon monoxide is
    endogenously formed as part of heme metabolism, Marks proposed that heme-derived carbon
    monoxide might function in a manner synonymous to that of nitric oxide. Indeed both
    systems produce low molecular weight gasses which are activators of soluble guanylate
    cyclase, and the catalytic formation of both gases are NADPH-dependent (3,29).</p>
    <p>But the nitric oxide- and carbon monoxide-generating systems also exhibit some very
    important differences. Nitric oxide is highly labile, exhibiting a biological half-life of
    seconds (29), whereas carbon monoxide is unusually stable and highly resistant to
    transformation (1,2). As mentioned earlier, nitric oxide is a powerful activator of
    soluble guanylate cyclase, whereas carbon monoxide is a weak activator of this
    cGMP-generating enzyme (8). Under most conditions the constitutive forms of nitric oxide
    synthase are primarily found in neurons and endothelium (29) but are relatively absent
    from vascular smooth muscle. While the constitutive isoform of heme oxygenase is similarly
    prevalent in neuronal and endothelial tissue domains (30), it differs from its nitric
    oxide-generating counterpart by being abundant within the vascular smooth muscle. Since
    heme oxygenase is abundant in the smooth muscle domain of most blood vessels, conditions
    which promote endothelial damage or dysfunction may potentially disrupt some aspects of
    the nitric oxide-generating system while leaving the heme-derived carbon
    monoxide-generating system intact.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Studying the heme-heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide system: tools and
    approaches</b></font></p>
    <p><b>Chronic heme oxygenase induction</b> </p>
    <p>Induction of heme oxygenase-1 protein is often accompanied by an array of &quot;heat
    shock&quot; stress-related proteins and functional derangements (21,30). Heavy metal salts
    and other stress-related events are often used to induce expression of heme oxygenase-1
    protein and promote heme oxygenase activity (30,31). While such chronic inductions may
    reflect potential pathological states which could lead to persistent elevations in
    endogenous carbon monoxide production, this technique may be less than optimal to
    distinguish the actions of heme oxygenase-derived carbon monoxide from those of the other
    simultaneously expressed heat-shock proteins.</p>
    <p><b>Acute manipulations of the heme-heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide system</b></p>
    <p>Studies which focus on the functional effects of endogenously formed carbon monoxide
    may alternatively be approached by increasing and decreasing tissue levels of acutely
    endogenously formed carbon monoxide. Unfortunately, no selective chelators or metabolizing
    agents are currently available to inactivate carbon monoxide once it has been formed. But
    the formation of heme-derived carbon monoxide can be increased by providing heme oxygenase
    substrate (3,23,26) or conversely decreased by using metalloporphyrins that compete with
    heme for binding to the heme oxygenase enzyme (13,19,21,23,24,27). Such a strategy has
    been used to identify heme-induced effects which arise from formation of a heme oxygenase
    product (19,23). Specifically, heme-induced effects which can be prevented and/or reversed
    by an inhibitor of heme oxygenase are likely to be consequent to the formation of a heme
    oxygenase product. As iron, biliverdin and carbon monoxide are the metabolic products of
    heme oxygenase-mediated metabolism of heme (3,21), the actions of these three products may
    in some cases be compared to identify the specific product which is most likely to account
    for the heme oxygenase-induced response.</p>
    <p>The use of heme to drive heme oxygenase activity in experimental settings is
    complicated by its tendency to aggregate in aqueous solutions at physiological pH (25,32)
    and to degrade during storage (32). An acetic environment may in some cases be used to
    increase porphyrin solubility, but such conditions may also damage porphyrin integrity
    (25). Alternatively, bases such as Tris and sodium hydroxide have been used to increase
    the solubility of porphyrins, but these caustic solvents may also promote substantial
    tissue damage. Some porphyrins are soluble in ethanol, but ethanol can alter porphyrin
    metabolism by driving the synthesis of dALA (24), the rate-limiting step in the formation
    of new heme. While disodium carbonate has been used to solubilize hematin for clinical
    applications (24), the resulting preparation is still susceptible to degradation during
    storage (32).</p>
    <p>The solubility limitations associated with heme can easily be overcome by dissolving it
    in an amino acid solution. Heme-L-arginate is one such commercially available preparation
    (32,33) which is used in the treatment of porphyrin metabolic disorders (24). This
    preparation boosts the solubility of heme to 38 mmol/l, maximizes monomeric heme
    availability, and yields a preparation which can be stored for months without discernible
    degradation (32). For some experimental protocols, heme-L-arginate may create
    methodological problems, since L-arginine is a substrate for nitric oxide
    synthase-mediated formation of nitric oxide (29). Alternatively, an arginine-free
    preparation of heme-L-lysinate can be made by replacing L-arginine with L-lysine (32).
    Since heme-L-arginate and heme-L-lysinate each demonstrate heme oxygenase substrate
    activities identical to that of hematin (32), these preparations seem particularly well
    suited as sources of heme for experimental purposes.</p>
    <p>Metalloporphyrins may be used to inhibit endogenous formation of carbon monoxide. These
    pharmacological tools resemble heme in their porphyrin structure, but the iron core is
    substituted by a heavy metal such as Zn, Sn, Cr, Co or Cu (19,21,27,30,34). The tendency
    for some of these substituted porphyrins to compete with heme for binding to the heme
    oxygenase enzyme has led to their use as heme oxygenase inhibitors. Accordingly, such
    inhibitors can also be used to inhibit the formation of heme-derived carbon monoxide (27).</p>
    <p>Photolability is a serious problem with some metalloporphyrins. Some metalloporphyrins,
    most notably those which are tin-bearing, can undergo non-enzymatic degradation to release
    carbon monoxide when they are exposed to light (35). Concerns have also been raised over
    the potential interactions of metalloporphyrins with soluble guanylate cyclase (36,37). It
    is abundantly clear that the substituted metalloporphyrins do not participate in the
    activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in a manner similar to heme (36), but
    demonstrations that these substituted metalloporphyrins produce functional effects which
    arise from their direct action on soluble guanylate cyclase have not been forthcoming.</p>
    <p>Carbon monoxide is an obvious tool used to confirm that a heme-induced effect may be
    attributed to the endogenously formed carbon monoxide product. An array of techniques for
    preparing and administering carbon monoxide have been explored (1). For <i>in vitro</i>
    studies, carbon monoxide is water soluble and thus can be easily prepared in physiological
    buffer solutions. In contrast, administration of carbon monoxide for <i>in vivo</i>
    studies can be substantially complicated by its distribution kinetics which are markedly
    influenced by the affinity of this gas for heme proteins (1,2). Carbon monoxide has been
    administered through inhalation (1), but the delivery of carbon monoxide to the tissues by
    this method is reliant on its delivery as carboxyhemoglobin. This means that carbon
    monoxide must bind to hemoglobin before it can be delivered to the tissues. In turn, this
    event produces hypoxia that must precede appreciable accumulations of carbon monoxide in
    the tissues. Intravenous administration of carbon monoxide solutions is equally
    disadvantageous because of this complication.</p>
    <p>The intraperitoneal administration of carbon monoxide may offer some advantages. Using
    this simple and efficient technique, marked changes in cardiovascular function can precede
    dramatic changes in carboxyhemoglobin levels (38). When carbon monoxide gas is injected
    into the peritoneum, its appearance in the vasculature as carboxyhemoglobin is not
    immediate and in some species may not plateau for hours (2). The delayed transit of this
    water soluble and low molecular weight gas from the peritoneum to the vascular space
    strongly suggests that the extravascular tissues also possess a marked affinity for carbon
    monoxide. Furthermore, it supports what toxicologists have emphasized for years, that
    carboxyhemoglobin levels are of limited value when judging the carbon monoxide content of
    the extravascular space (1,2).</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>The heme-heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide system and cardiovascular
    functions</b></font></p>
    <p>Since blood pressure is calculated as the product of cardiac output and total
    peripheral resistance, cardiovascular functional studies accordingly focus on these
    determinants. Based upon the toxicological literature and the logical rationale proposed
    by Gerald Marks (2,4,8), it appears that heme-derived carbon monoxide might serve as a
    vasodilator and accordingly tend to be vasodepressive.</p>
    <p><b>Chronic blood pressure effects of the heme-heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide system</b></p>
    <p>Volumes have been published on various aspects of heme oxygenase induction (21,30).
    Studies preceding the overt suggestion that endogenous carbon monoxide may participate in
    biological functions showed that inducers of heme oxygenase such as SnCl<sub>2</sub> could
    chronically slow the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)
    (31). Since the vasodepressive effects were accompanied by decreases in microsomal
    cytochrome content, those early studies attributed the blood pressure lowering effects of
    heme oxygenase induction to a state of heme depletion and a consequent reduction of the
    formation of cytP450-derived vasoconstrictive eicosanoids (31). While this explanation was
    consistent with the findings, those corollary studies did not directly verify a state of
    free heme depletion. It was then also shown that chronic heme loading could induce heme
    oxygenase and similarly slow down the development of hypertension in SHRs (39). Since
    monomeric free heme is the substrate for heme oxygenase, and since heme loading is known
    to increase bilirubin production, this suggests that heme substrate availability is not
    impaired by these treatments. Rather, it supports the idea that a heme oxygenase product
    such as carbon monoxide may be involved in the vasodepressive effect.</p>
    <p>Certainly such evidence does not preclude a role for cytP450-derived eicosanoids in
    heme oxygenase-induced vasodepression. Indeed, changes in cytP450 and heme oxygenase
    content accompany a variety of chronic disease states (21,30,31). Nonetheless, studies
    which rely solely on chronic corollaries between induction and functions are not able to
    distinguish the effects of heme oxygenase activity from those of the other simultaneously
    expressed heat-shock proteins. Interpretations of studies using chronic treatment of heme
    oxygenase inhibitors are similarly complicated as such inhibitors tend to induce heme
    oxygenase along with other heat-shock proteins (21,31), while at the same time directly
    inhibiting heme oxygenase. In addition, these chronic treatments may potentially produce
    effects by altering other less investigated functional aspects of porphyrin
    metabolism-dependent processes such as dALA synthase activity or glutathione metabolism
    (24). Furthermore, chronic inhibition of heme oxygenase activity through the use of
    metalloporphyrins or even highly specific antibodies may have limited influence on total
    carbon monoxide production as sources of nonheme-derived carbon monoxide may be greatly
    amplified during such conditions (27).</p>
    <p><b>Acute blood pressure effects of the heme-heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide system</b></p>
    <p>The use of heme oxygenase substrates and inhibitors to acutely manipulate heme
    oxygenase activity constitutes a major development for studying the biological actions of
    the heme-heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide system. This strategy optimizes the ability to
    examine heme oxygenase-related effects in a setting which maximally precedes potential
    enzyme induction and shifting in carbon monoxide sources. By so doing, these inhibitors of
    heme oxygenase may also be used to evaluate the contributions of the heme-heme
    oxygenase-carbon monoxide system to basal functions.</p>
    <p>Systemic administration of metalloporphyrins which inhibit heme oxygenase can rapidly
    produce vasoconstriction and raise blood pressure in rats (40). This suggests that a heme
    oxygenase product serves to reduce vascular tone. In contrast, heme preparations that
    drive heme oxygenase-mediated formation of carbon monoxide, such as heme-L-lysinate, lower
    blood pressure in chronically hypertensive SHR and DOCA-salt rat models and in rats made
    acutely hypertensive by phenylephrine infusion (23). These heme-induced decreases in blood
    pressure can be prevented by pretreatment with inhibitors of heme oxygenase. This suggests
    that the vasodepressive actions of heme are consequent to the formation of a heme
    oxygenase product.</p>
    <p>It is well established that the heme oxygenase-mediated degradation of heme forms three
    products: iron, biliverdin and carbon monoxide (3). Iron chelation does not prevent
    heme-induced vasodepression in SHRs (23), and biliverdin does not acutely promote
    vasodepression in either normotensive or hypertensive models (23,40). However,
    intraperitoneal injection of carbon monoxide does preferentially lower blood pressure in
    hypertensive models (23). Thus, it appears that the heme-induced vasodepression is more
    likely to arise from the formation of the carbon monoxide product.</p>
    <p>Hypertensive models do seem to display an enhanced sensitivity for heme-induced
    vasodepression (23). While this might suggest that the hypertensive models such as the
    SHRs are heme-, heme oxygenase-, or carbon monoxide-deficient compared to normotensive
    Sprague-Dawleys, these two strains do not differ in plasma bilirubin content (23).
    Furthermore, matched loadings with heme preferentially lower blood pressure in the
    hypertensive models despite similar 2-3-fold elevations in the plasma bilirubin content in
    both normotensive and hypertensive strains. A variety of hypertensive models have been
    found to be both acutely (23) and chronically (1) more sensitive to the vasodepressive
    actions of exogenously applied carbon monoxide than their normotensive counterparts. These
    tendencies indicate that these normotensive and hypertensive models do not appear to
    differ in their abilities to generate heme oxygenase products, including carbon monoxide.
    Rather they suggest that SHRs, and perhaps other hypertensive models as well, may be more
    sensitive to the vasodepressant actions of the carbon monoxide product.</p>
    <p><b>CNS involvement in heme oxygenase-related cardiovascular effects</b></p>
    <p>Heme oxygenase and its activity have been identified in the brain (21,40-42), but its
    distribution is such that it forms distinct tracts (41). While some metalloporphyrins like
    ZnDPBG have been designed to pass the blood brain barrier to inhibit heme oxygenase
    activity in the brain (27,40), studies using radiolabeled tags show that heme does not
    pass the blood brain barrier (33). In addition, dALA synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in
    the formation of new heme, and the other enzymes involved in heme synthesis have been
    identified in brain tissues (24). The finding that the brain is insulated from
    infiltration by circulating heme but locally possesses the metabolic processes for heme
    synthesis suggests that the CNS may constitute a heme oxygenase functional unit which is
    distinct from that of peripheral tissues.</p>
    <p>Intraperitoneal administration of ZnDPBG can inhibit heme oxygenase activity both at
    the periphery and in the brain, decrease the systemic production of carbon monoxide (27),
    and increase the blood pressure of the awake rat in a manner which is paralleled by an
    increase in total peripheral resistance (40). This pressor response can be prevented by
    alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonists or pharmacological blockade of ganglionic
    function, but not by bilateral sino-aortic deafferentation. These findings suggest that
    ZnDPBG-induced elevations in blood pressure may involve a heme oxygenase-related action
    which is central (40,43).</p>
    <p>The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) is the site of termination of cardiovascular and
    respiratory afferent fibers in the medulla oblongata (44) and is a key structure in
    glutamatergic-mediated cardiovascular afferents and an integrative region of baroreceptor
    and chemoreceptor responses (45). Systemic inhibition of heme oxygenase has been shown to
    attenuate the pressure-bradycardia relationship, which is modulated via the NTS (43).
    Inhibitors of heme oxygenase can affect glutamatergic-mediated depolarization in isolated
    NTS preparations (46). Since isolated NTS tissues respond to manipulations of the
    heme-heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide system, and since the NTS is involved both in the
    modulation of baroreceptor reflex activity and in the establishment of blood pressure, it
    seems that the NTS might be involved in the ZnDPBG-induced pressor response.</p>
    <p>This notion is supported by the observation that microinjections of ZnDPBG into the NTS
    are able to increase blood pressure in a manner that can be reversed by microinjections of
    carbon monoxide (43). Likewise, microinjections of carbon monoxide into the NTS can
    reverse the elevation in blood pressure produced by systemic administration of ZnDPBG
    (43). Thus it appears that the heme oxygenase product formed in the NTS exerts a
    vasodepressive influence; it also appears that the heme oxygenase product is likely to be
    carbon monoxide.</p>
    <p>L-Glutamate is a neurotransmitter involved in NTS-mediated afferent baroreceptor
    activity. NTS microinjections of heme oxygenase inhibitors do attenuate the pressor
    responses to microinjections of L-glutamate (47) and interfere with baroreceptor activity.
    Such findings suggest that heme metabolism may locally interact with glutamatergic
    transmission in the NTS. Even so, it remains unclear if these glutamatergic-linked effects
    arise solely from its influences on carbon monoxide product formation.</p>
    <p>While evidence is mounting to suggest neuromodulatory roles for heme oxygenase-derived
    carbon monoxide, special caution should be observed when designing and interpreting CNS
    studies using metalloporphyrins. The potential of metalloporphyrin and heme to affect the
    CNS independently of carbon monoxide generation may represent a highly complicated topic.
    In the porphyrin metabolic pathway, the formation of dALA is enzymatically mediated and
    constitutes the rate-limiting step in the formation of new heme (24). In turn, the
    concentration of free heme serves as a feedback inhibitor of dALA synthase activity. This
    is the mechanism by which tissue levels of heme are effectively maintained. This heme
    precursor, dALA, is structurally related to gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). In addition,
    heme itself demonstrates affinity for benzodiazepine receptors. It is accepted that GABA
    and benzodiazepine receptor functions are cooperative and may play important roles in
    central regulation of blood pressure. While the effects of dALA on GABA receptors and the
    effects of heme on benzodiazepine receptor functions have not been fully characterized, it
    should be mentioned that any maneuver which influences heme availability may also
    potentially affect benzodiazepine- and GABA-related functions in the CNS.</p>
    <p>Acute intact animal studies which use systemic administration of heme are likely to be
    less complicated by CNS-related effects since heme does not cross the blood brain
    barrier&nbsp;(33). However, inhibitors of heme oxygenase which cross the blood brain
    barrier (40), and carbon monoxide as well (1,2), can potentially affect the blood pressure
    by acting directly on the NTS or other central structures. Since the CNS exerts a powerful
    influence on cardiovascular functions, the actions of the heme-heme oxygenase-carbon
    monoxide system directly on vascular activity may be best addressed by using isolated
    vessel preparations which are devoid of central and circulating influences.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Endogenous carbon monoxide and vascular tone: dual actions</b></font></p>
    <p><b>Carbon monoxide as a vasoconstrictor</b></p>
    <p>Heme oxygenase has been identified both in arteriolar and venular smooth muscle, and
    has also been located in arteriolar endothelium (48). The findings that carbon monoxide
    can stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase (8) and relax preparations of vascular smooth
    muscle (11) have prompted suggestions that carbon monoxide may lower blood pressure by
    promoting vasodilation (4). In contrast, earlier studies (7,49-52) have provided ample
    evidence that carbon monoxide can bind to nitric oxide synthase and inhibit the production
    of nitric oxide, a vasodilator. If so, it might be expected that carbon monoxide could
    block basal nitric oxide production and cause vasoconstriction with a consequent increase
    in blood pressure. While these two functionally opposing roles of endogenously formed
    carbon monoxide in vascular tone are equally plausible, several studies using isolated
    vessels and perfused preparations (7,53-56) have suggested that heme-derived carbon
    monoxide may be vasodilatory. Such reports have understandably typified carbon monoxide as
    a vasodilator.</p>
    <p>What was lacking was a strategic attempt to elucidate the endothelial-dependent roles
    of endogenously formed carbon monoxide from those which are endothelium-independent. In an
    attempt to clarify this issue, we recently found that heme can elicit vasodilation of
    isolated superfused rat gracilis first-order arterioles denuded of endothelium, in a
    manner which is readily reversed by an inhibitor of heme oxygenase (57). In that study,
    carbon monoxide similarly elicited vasodilation in the preparations denuded of
    endothelium. These observations suggest that a heme oxygenase product, apparently carbon
    monoxide, can produce vasodilation of these resistance vessels in a manner which is
    endothelium-independent. It also suggests that the vasodilatory actions of heme can be
    independent of the generation of endothelium-derived factors.</p>
    <p>In sharp contrast, we found that heme elicited a vasoconstriction in similarly prepared
    arterioles when the endothelium was left intact (57). In addition, we found that the
    heme-induced vasoconstriction was readily reversed by the further inclusion of an
    inhibitor of heme oxygenase. Furthermore, in similarly prepared vessels in which the
    endothelium was left intact, we found that exogenously applied carbon monoxide could also
    elicit a vasoconstrictive response. These frankly unexpected findings suggested that a
    heme oxygenase product, which was mimicked by carbon monoxide, could also elicit
    vasoconstriction by 1)&nbsp;facilitating the release of a vasoconstrictive agent from the
    endothelium or by 2)&nbsp;interfering with the release of an endothelium-derived relaxing
    factor.</p>
    <p>Nitric oxide is an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (29). In addition, nitric oxide
    synthase-mediated formation of nitric oxide has been repeatedly shown to be inhibited by
    carbon monoxide (7,49-52). If the observed endothelium-dependent HLL-induced
    vasoconstriction of the gracilis arteriole preparations were a consequence of inhibition
    of nitric oxide synthase activity by endogenously formed carbon monoxide, it would seem
    reasonable that the blockade of nitric oxide formation should allow the vasodilatory
    influences of heme-derived carbon monoxide to predominate.</p>
    <p>In vessels with intact endothelium and in which L-NAME is present to maximally inhibit
    nitric oxide synthesis, we find that heme does elicit vasodilation in a manner which is
    reversed by inhibitors of heme oxygenase (12,53,57). Blockade of nitric oxide synthases
    similarly allows the vasodilatory effects of carbon monoxide to be displayed even when the
    endothelium is present (12,53,57). Accordingly, the simplest explanation is that
    heme-derived carbon monoxide, specifically that formed in smooth muscle, may serve to
    promote vasodilation by a local action. Simultaneously these vasodilatory actions may be
    buffered by the consequent withdrawal of the vasodilatory influences of
    endothelium-derived nitric oxide.</p>
    <p>While such observations are consistent with the well-documented biochemical actions of
    carbon monoxide to block nitric oxide synthase, they are admittedly in sharp contrast to
    the recent dogma which highlights the vasodilatory actions of carbon monoxide. Coceani et
    al. (54) have reported that vasodilation can be elicited by heme substrate in intact lamb
    ductus arteriosus vessels. Such findings may seem in contrast to our recent findings, but
    they have carefully documented that heme oxygenase is localized in the smooth muscle
    domain of their ductus vessels, but not present in the endothelium.</p>
    <p>Given the widely accepted importance of the nitric oxide system for multiple biological
    processes (29), the possibility of a carbon monoxide/nitric oxide interaction should be
    explored to determine its hemodynamic functional significance. Consideration of this
    potential interaction is crucial, since ignorance of this feature might seriously confound
    the interpretations of key experiments in this newly emerging area of endogenous carbon
    monoxide research.</p>
    <p><b>Vasodilatory influences of endogenous carbon monoxide</b></p>
    <p>While we recently suggested that carbon monoxide may promote vasoconstriction by
    interfering with the vasodilatory influences of the nitric oxide system, that suggestion
    was certainly not intended to overlook the vasodilatory influences of endogenously formed
    carbon monoxide. Given the apparent effects of carbon monoxide attenuating the
    vasodilatory influences of the nitric oxide vasodilatory system, the vasodilatory effects
    of heme can be optimized by using preparations in which the nitric oxide system is
    inhibited.</p>
    <p>In isolated superfused rat gracilis first-order arterioles with intact endothelium, in
    an environment containing L-NAME to maximally inhibit nitric oxide synthase, heme does
    promote vasodilation in a manner which is readily reversed by inhibitors of heme oxygenase
    (53). This suggests the heme-induced vasodilatory response arises from the generation of a
    heme oxygenase product. These heme-induced vasodilatory effects are not prevented by an
    iron chelator or mimicked by biliverdin. However, carbon monoxide does mimic this
    heme-induced dilation of similar preparations. This is the evidence that the vasodilatory
    heme oxygenase product is most likely to be carbon monoxide.</p>
    <p>In similarly prepared resistance vessels, in which the nitric oxide system has been
    maximally inhibited, inhibitors of heme oxygenase alone produce a striking
    vasoconstriction (12). This vasoconstrictive effect can be both prevented and reversed by
    carbon monoxide, but cannot be prevented by a nitric oxide donor. These findings suggest
    that the basal production of carbon monoxide may exert a substantial vasodilatory
    influence on these resistance vessels.</p>
    <p>Concerns have recently surfaced over potential interactions between metalloporphyrins
    and soluble guanylate cyclase (36, 37). However, the arteriolar constriction produced by
    chromium mesoporphyrin is unaffected by an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase (12).
    Furthermore, vasodilatory actions of exogenously applied carbon monoxide or heme also
    appear to be unaffected by an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase in isolated
    arteriolar preparations (12). Accordingly, it appears that heme, at least in some
    conditions, carbon monoxide and metalloporphyrins can produce effects which are unrelated
    to soluble guanylate cyclase activity. While the mechanisms underlying acute carbon
    monoxide-induced relaxation of vascular smooth muscle have yet to be clarified, they
    apparently arise independently from P-450-, endothelin- or soluble guanylate
    cyclase-related activities (12).</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Proposed organization for endogenously derived carbon monoxide
    effects on cardiovascular functions</b></font></p>
    <p>An abundance of literature has accumulated describing intricate details of mechanisms
    which contribute to heme oxygenase expression. There has also been a virtually endless
    trail of proposed biochemical interactions of carbon monoxide and heme metabolites with
    almost every imaginable messenger system. While such information is certainly of
    tremendous importance, there may have been a tendency for the biochemistry to overwhelm
    the functional effects of this newly explored system. The identification of the primary
    functions of endogenously formed carbon monoxide may serve as a point of orientation in
    the search to identify the underlying primary biochemical and molecular biological
    mechanisms. By such an approach, the physiological contributions of the heme-heme
    oxygenase-carbon monoxide system may best be appreciated.</p>
    <p>The current review has preferentially emphasized the apparent functional consequences
    of the heme-heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide system in an attempt to organize a framework to
    identify the primary influences of endogenously formed carbon monoxide on cardiovascular
    functions. What seems to be emerging are multiple mechanisms by which endogenously formed
    carbon monoxide exerts effects on cardiovascular control.</p>
    <p>Specifically, heme-derived carbon monoxide generated within vascular smooth muscle
    appears to be vasodilatory. This vasodilatory influence may be countered by carbon
    monoxide-induced withdrawal of the endothelium-dependent vasodilatory influence of the
    nitric oxide system. This suggests that under some conditions carbon monoxide may have
    little direct effect on basal vascular tone. Even so, such conditions could still
    interfere with the dynamic influences related to shear force-mediated changes of the
    nitric oxide system and consequently amplify the vasoactive actions of other agents. Such
    an arrangement means that carbon monoxide, even the endogenously formed one, may promote a
    propensity for vasospasms. Since carbon monoxide has been shown to compete with L-arginine
    for binding to nitric oxide synthase, then L-arginine may potentially protect nitric oxide
    synthase from the inhibitory actions of carbon monoxide. It should be emphasized that it
    is not clear to what extent the nitric oxide and carbon monoxide systems interact <i>in
    vivo</i>. Nonetheless, potential interactions between the carbon monoxide- and nitric
    oxide-generating systems should be seriously considered, especially when isolated
    preparations are involved.</p>
    <p>In addition to the proposed endothelium-dependent and -independent actions of carbon
    monoxide on vascular tone, it appears that carbon monoxide can affect blood pressure
    through CNS-mediated influences on vascular tone and baroreceptor reflex functions. One
    region in the brain that has been strongly implicated as participating in these functions
    is the NTS. In some cases, the actions of the CNS may exert a third influence which&quot;
    tips the balance&quot; of the directly offsetting endothelium-dependent and -independent
    actions of carbon monoxide on the vasculature.</p>
    <p>While the search for functional roles for the heme-heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide
    system remains in its infancy, the accrued evidence strongly suggests that the heme
    metabolic system is doing more than simply generating carbon monoxide as a waste product.
    More specifically, the evidence suggests that heme-derived carbon monoxide may exert
    effects on blood pressure by influencing both endothelium-dependent and -independent
    functions in the vasculature, and these peripheral effects may be further adjusted by
    carbon monoxide-induced influences arising through the central nervous system.</p>
