NOTE!!!!

Backup all files before translating!!

The current *.bat files (for Windows OS) for translating to other languages do not work correctly.
Certain characters eg { } and | cause parts of the files to be omitted, or premature end of the translation.
Repeatable groups ( ... ) may also end the process prematurely. Many of the processing pft's (eg ahhidd.pft)
which do not contain words needing translation, become corrupted by the translation process, and therefore 
need to be restored from originals.

The delimiters for the words in the translation tables have been changed from {..} to {{..}}, this fixes 
the conflict caused by { } which appear in Javascript.

The *.bat files have been changed accordingly, and also changed to mx2.exe (mx is not a Windows program), 
and explicit paths inserted.

The translation tables (es.txt etc) as supplied, had become corrupted, using the wrong end-of-line 
character (ASCII 13, which is visible in Notepad, but many other editors eg MS Word, will render this
character on screen differently). This caused replacements to be skipped. It is important to verify that 
the correct end-of-line character is used, by viewing in Notepad or an old-fasihioned DOS editor.

Be sure to compare the results with the originals intended!!
Restore the sections of which are deleted after the process comes to a vertical bar |  !!

The language translation files have been expanded with additional phrases.
