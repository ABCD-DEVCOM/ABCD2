<p>Preface
I feel honoured to have this opportunity to write a book about the fundamental of supply chain management for the 
BookBoon.com Ltd and Ventus Publishing ApS. The chosen topic represents my attempt to respond to the growing 
demand for better understanding of supply chain management from managers, academics and graduate students alike. 
</p>
<p>This book is based upon my 15 years of teaching experience gained through working in 6 different countries around world. 
Most of my courses on supply chain management were targeted at the master and executive levels, from which I have 
learned and enjoyed as much as my students do. The most important lesson I learned is that supply chain management 
is a dynamic and evolving subject. It is not a subject that just needs to be taught, but the one needs to be constantly 
developed. To certain extent, this book will hopefully contribute to such a development.
</p>
<p>Due to the constraints in the number of pages, this book will primarily focus on the fundamental principles of supply chain 
management. It will cover all the key conceptual areas with short business cases, but is limited in scope on management 
skill coaching. The book is particularly suitable for those readers who may have come across the subject anecdotally but 
have never studied it systematically.
</p>
<p>In order to continuously improve my book, I would appreciate any suggestions and comments. Please do not hesitate to 
get in touch with me through: dawei.lu12@gmail.com.

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>1 Introduction
1.1 Why Supply Chain Management 
</p>
<p>A supply chain is basically a group of independent organisations connected together through the products and services 
that they separately and/or jointly add value on in order to deliver them to the end consumer. It is very much an extended 
concept of an organisation which adds value to its products or services and delivers them to its customers. But what is the 
benefit of understanding the value adding from the supply chain perspective? Why managing supply chain is becoming 
necessary and important to today&rsquo;s business success? These are some of the fundamental questions that must be first 
addressed before discussing the &ldquo;how to&rdquo; questions. 
</p>
<p>Over the last three decades, the concept and theory of business management have undergone profound changes and 
development. Many old ways of doing business have been challenged and many new ideas and approaches have been 
created, among them are business process re-engineering, strategic management, lean thinking, agile manufacturing, 
balanced scorecard, blue ocean strategy, &hellip; just to name a few. Supply chain management is undoubtedly one of those 
new and well grown management approaches emerged and rapidly developed across all industries around the world. 
</p>
<p>The earliest appearance of the term &lsquo;supply chain management&rsquo; as we know it today published in recognisable media and 
literatures can be traced back to the early 1980s. More precisely, it first appeared in a Financial Times article written by 
Oliver and Webber in 1982 describing the range of activities performed by the organization in procuring and managing 
supplies. However the early publications of supply chain management in the 1980s were mainly focused on purchasing 
activities and cost reduction related activities. The major development and the significant increases of publications in the 
areas of supply chain integration and supplier-buyer relationship came in 1990s when the concept as we know it today 
was gradually established.
</p>
<p>It is therefore clear that supply chain management is not one of the legacy academic subjects existed for hundreds or 
thousands of years, but rather a young and even nascent subject. It is only recently that business world started making use 
of this concept. So, the question is &ldquo;Why now?&rdquo; A convincing answer to this question is that our business environment has 
changed, which includes globalisation, more severe competition, heightened customer expectation, technological impact 
and geopolitical factors and so on. Under such a renewed business environment, an organisation focused management 
approach is no longer adequate to deliver the required competitiveness. Managers must therefore understand that their 
businesses are only part of the supply chains that they participated and it is the supply chain that wins or loses the 
competition.
</p>
<p>Thus, the arena of competition is moving from &lsquo;organisation against organisation&rsquo; to &lsquo;supply chain against supply chain&rsquo;. 
The survival of any business today is no longer solely dependent on its own ability to compete but rather on the ability 
to cooperate within the supply chain. The seemingly independent relation between the organisations within the supply 
chain becomes ever more interdependent. You &ldquo;sink or swim with the supply chain.&rdquo; It is for this reason that gives rise to 
the need for supply chain management.</p>

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>Consequently, aspiring to become an excellent business simply through an entirely inward looking management approach 
can be very illusive. What&rsquo;s more practical and indeed more assured way of better managing a business is to managing it 
along with the supply chain through appropriate strategic positioning, adequate structural configuration, collaboration, 
integration and leadership. The paramount importance of doing so does not derive from the theories or reasoning, rather 
it is withstood by the business performance improvement and market measured customer results. It is the tangible benefits 
and success that it delivers makes the subject important.
</p>
<p>Supply chain management is also pervasive and ubiquitous. One can hardly find any aspect of business that has nothing 
to do with supply chain management. Take an example of quality management &ndash; a very important part of today&rsquo;s business 
management, and ask yourself a question: can you manage and improve the quality standard of your product or service 
measured by the end-consumer without managing the suppliers and buyers in the supply chain at all? Of course not. 
Business value creation is always a collective contribution from the whole involved supply chain. 
</p>
<p>1.2 Defining supply chains 
</p>
<p>Ploughing through the plethora of literatures, one will come to realise that there are as many different definitions as many 
of those who cared to write about it. However, a broad conceptual consensus on the notion of Supply Chain (SC) and 
Supply Chain Management (SCM) is beyond anybody&rsquo;s reasonable doubt. Based on that, the author would like to offer 
his definition of SC here and SCM in the next section.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In this definition, there are a number of key characteristics that have been used to portrait a supply chain. First, a supply 
chain is formed and can only be formed if there are more than one participating companies. Second, the participating 
companies within a supply chain normally do not belong to the same business ownership, and hence there is a legal 
independence in between. Third, those companies are inter-connected on the common commitment to add value to the 
steam of material flow that run through the supply chain. This material flow, to each company, comes in as the transformed 
inputs and goes out as the value added outputs.
</p>
<p>Intuitively, one can imagine a supply chain as something resembles a &ldquo;chain&rdquo;, in which the &ldquo;links&rdquo; are the participating 
companies that are inter-connected in the value adding process (see figure 1). The link on the upstream side of the 
material flow is the supplier&rsquo;s supplier; and on the downstream side of the material flow is the customer. There is usually 
an OEM &ndash; Original Equipment Manufacturer in between. The OBM sometimes is represented by OBM &ndash; Original Brand 
Manufacturer, or sometimes simply the &ldquo;focal company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>Figure 1. The basic Supply Chain model
</p>
<p>At the end of a supply chain is the product and/or service that are created by the supply chain for the end consumer. Thus, 
the fundamental reason of a supply chain&rsquo;s existence is hinged on to serving the end-consumer in the market place. The 
degree of how well a supply chain can serve their consumer ultimately defines its competitive edge in the market place.
</p>
<p>It is understandable that in real-world a supply chain is much more complex than the one depicted in Figure1. It is not 
really a &ldquo;chain&rdquo;, rather it is more like a &ldquo;network&rdquo;, when you consider that there are usually multiple suppliers and multiple 
customers for each participating companies in the chain. There are also possible nested chains within the chains. For 
example an engine manufacturing supply chain is a nested supply chain within the connected automobile supply chain. 
</p>
<p>Depend on how would like to see the supply chain, there are similar but different names you may like to call the supply 
chain. If you view a supply chain as basically a chain of value adding activities, you may like to call it &ldquo;Value Chain&rdquo;; if 
you perceive a supply chain as continuous demands originated from the consumer and stretched to upstream suppliers, 
you may like to call the supply chain the &ldquo;Demand Chain&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Since the business connections between organisations are pervasive, how could one draw a boundary of a supply chain? 
In order to answer this question, one needs to understand the four intrinsic flows of a supply chain. 
</p>
<p>Material Flow: All manufacturing supply chains have material flows from the raw materials at the beginning of the supply 
chain to the finished products at the end of the supply chain. A furniture-making supply chain will have the wood cut 
down from forest at the beginning of its supply chain and home furniture at the end of supply chain. The continuous flow 
of wood been transformed through the chain and end up to furniture ties the whole supply chain together and defines 
its clear boundary. A furniture supply chain can never be confused with a chocolate manufacturing supply chain because 
the material flows in between are clearly different and never will they cross with each other.</p>

</p>
<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>Information Flow: All supply chain s have and make use of information flows. Throughout a supply chain there are 
multitude of information flows such as demand information flow, forecasting information flow, production and scheduling 
information flows, and design and NPI information flows. Unlike the material flow the information can run both 
directions, towards upstream and downstream alike. Interestingly most of them are unique to the specific supply chain. The 
information of woman&rsquo;s fashion clothing has no value to a motorbike supply chain. Any supply chain will have its own set 
of information flows that are vital to its existence which are often jealously protected against those of other supply chains.
</p>
<p>Finance Flow: All supply chain have finance flow. It is basically the money flow or the blood stream of a supply chain. 
Without it, a supply chain will surely demise. However, for any supply chain, there is only one single source of such finance 
flow &ndash; the en-consumer. This understanding of single source of finance has led to a concept of &ldquo;single entity&rdquo; perspective 
of a supply chain, which is a very useful foundation for supply chain integration and collaboration. The distribution 
and sharing of this single financial resource fairly across a supply chain will allow for the better alignment between the 
contribution and reward for the participating companies. 
</p>
<p>Commercial flow: All supply chain represents a transactional commercial flow. This means that the material flow that run 
through the supply chain changes its ownership from one company to another, from supplier to buyer. The transactional 
process of buying and selling shifts the material flow&rsquo;s ownership from the supplier to the buyer repeatedly until the end 
of the supply chain &ndash; the end-consumer. This transactional commercial flow will only take place in a supply chain where 
there are more than one companies. On the other hand, if it is with an organisation there will be material flow, but no 
ownership change, and hence no commercial flow.
</p>
<p>The four flows described above not only better explain the function of the supply chain, but also define it more rigorously. 
They represent four major areas of concerns and research activities in the supply chain management, which covers most 
of the known issues in the published literatures.
</p>
<p>1.2 Customer Orientation 
</p>
<p>Having understood the supply chain model, one may ask &ldquo;Is the end-consumer a part of the supply chain?&rdquo; Most people 
will say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, because consumer give the demand information; consumer provide the financial reward and so on. But the 
author will argue that strictly speaking the end-consumer is NOT part of the supply chain; the supply chain only extend 
from the very raw material suppliers to the retailer (if that&rsquo;s the last link in the supply chain before the end-consumer). 
There are number of fundamental reasons to support this argument.
</p>
<p>1) First, all supply chain supplies, and every member of the supply chain supplies; but the consumer DON&rsquo;T, 
it demands instead of supply. The fundamental function of a supply chain is to supply; and the consumer is 
the recipient of the supply, but not a part of the supply. Supply chain&rsquo;s existence is based on the existence of 
the demand from the consumer. Supply chain treats consumer as the object which it serves. If a supply chain 
contains the consumer within itself, then it will have no object to serve and no recipient to take the supply; 
and it will lose its purpose of existence.</p>

</p>
<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>2) Second, a supply chain adds value to the product (or transformed inputs), but the consumer DON&rsquo;T. 
Consumer consumes the product and depletes its market value. Used goods are always cheaper than the new 
ones. A supply chain and every member in it have the irrefutable duty to add values to the material flow, and 
they must learn how to improve the business and its management; but consumers will never need to do that. 
Their job is to use the money to vote which supply chain best satisfy their demand.
</p>
<p>3) Third, a supply chain is always specialised and a consumer is always general. A computer manufacturing 
supply chain only produces computers, whilst a consumer will have to buy food, clothing, and automobile 
as well as computers. Due to the extremely divers nature of consumer&rsquo;s purchasing, to put the consumer 
as part of a supply chain will not be helpful in understanding the nature of a supply chain and may cause 
considerable confusion theoretically and logically.
</p>
<p>Based on these three fundamental differences between the nature of supply chain and that of the consumer, it is more 
appropriate and less confusion if we separate the consumer away from the concept of the supply chain. This definition of 
supply chain without consumer will not deprive the immense benefits that consumer may contribute to the supply chain. 
How the end-consumer plays this pivotal role in the existence and the management of supply chain is the core notion of 
supply chain management.
</p>
<p>The end-consumer to a supply chain is perhaps the most important factor of all as far as its management is concerned. 
Everything a supply chain does is driven by the needs and wants of the end-consumer. The contents of SCM are populated 
with the approaches, activities as well as the strategies that are aiming at delivering the products and services to satisfy the 
end-consumer. Therefore, it is safe to say that the SCM should be and has always been a customer centred management. 
This reflects the typical characteristic of supply chain&rsquo;s customer orientation.

<p>Fundamentals of Supply Chain Management
</p>
<p>13 
</p>
<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>Not only the end-consumer serves as the ultimate objective, it also provides vital information and practical assistance to 
the decision making in the process of supply chain management. The end-consumers needs and wants, where they are, 
how many they are and how much they can afford and etc. give the supply chain manager some very precise guidance as 
how to achieve market responsiveness.
</p>
<p>It is therefore beyond the shadow of doubt that supply chain and its management have always been, still are, and will 
certainly continue to be customer oriented. This customer orientation gives the fundamental reason and purpose of its 
existence. It also ensures that supply chain management has to be a system perspective based management approach that 
engages every participating member of the supply chain to align to the customer orientation. 
</p>
<p>1.3 Defining Supply Chain Management
</p>
<p>Defining the supply chain management can be both dead easy and extremely difficult. It is dead easy because it is so 
widely known and widely practiced in almost all businesses. There is hardly a need to teach the &ldquo;A, B, C&rdquo; again. It is also 
extremely difficult because the definition must capture all what supply chain management in practice has reached far and 
wide. As an attempt, the author proffers the following definition:
</p>
<p>This definition squared out the nagging confusion between organisational business management and supply chain 
management. Rarely any aspect of organisational business management is not related to or influenced by the external 
firms in the supply chain. Thus the best way to manage the business is to take into consideration and engage with the 
external organisations in the decision making in order to achieve the ultimate business objectives &ndash; that means supply 
chain management. 
</p>
<p>In other words, trying to identify a set of supply chain management activities that is not or nothing to do with any known 
business management activities would futile. The inception of the supply chain management concept did not create a new 
set of functional activities that has never been carried out before. What it created is a new way of understanding on how 
the business activities might be better carried out.
</p>
<p>The supply chain management defined as such has already elevated the modern business management concept from the 
organisational focused domain to the supply chain focused system giving rise to more effectiveness in achieving the strategic 
objectives. Today&rsquo;s competition is no longer seen as the company against the company but the supply chain against the 
supply chain. Supply chain management is therefore a new perspective towards the old activities. </p>

</p>
<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>This definition effectively explains why supply chain management can be done in such vastly diverse ways; why apparently 
completely different management activities can often be called supply chain management; why the same traditional 
management function is now been entitled as supply chain management; and so on. The answer is simply that because 
we start view the management issues and taking actions from the supply chain perspective. 
</p>
<p>This definition certainly gives the supply chain management concept a ubiquitous and pervasive nature. But, that does not 
mean that there is nothing uniquely identifiable on its own. One can still identify some practically very useful conceptual 
components of the supply chain management. Any supply chain management practice and activities is captured by the 
three conceptual components: Supply Chain Configuration; Supply Chain Relationship; and Supply Chain Coordination.
</p>
<p>Figure 2. Supply Chain Management conceptual model
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Supply Chain Configuration is about how a supply chain is constructed from all its participating firms. This 
includes how big is the supply base for OEM (original equipment manufacturer); how wide or narrow is the 
extent of vertical integration (which is the single ownership of consecutive activities along the supply chain); 
how much of the OEM&rsquo;s operations are outsourced; how the downstream distribution channel is designed; 
and so on. It is also known as supply chain architecture. The decision on supply chain configuration is 
strategic and at a higher level.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Supply Chain Relationship is about inter-firm relationships across the supply chain albeit the key focus of 
relationship is often around the OEM and its first tier suppliers and first tier customers and the relationship 
in between. The type and level of the relationship is determined by the contents of inter-organisational 
exchanges. The relationship is likely to be &ldquo;arm&rsquo;s length&rdquo; if they only exchanged the volume and price of 
the transaction; on the other hand, the relationship would be regarded as close partnership if the parties 
exchanged their vision, investment planning, NPI process and detailed financial information. The decision 
on supply chain relationship is both strategic and operational.</p>

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Supply Chain Coordination refers mainly to the inter-firm operational coordination within a supply chain. 
It involves the coordination of continuous material flows from the suppliers to the buyers and through to 
the end-consumer in a preferably JIM manner. Inventory management throughout the supply chain could 
be a key focal point for the coordination. Production capacity, forecasting, manufacturing scheduling, even 
customer services will all constitute the main contents of the coordination activities in the supply chain. The 
decision on the supply chain coordination tends to be operational.
</p>
<p>There is, however, one thing in common amongst the three key supply chain management focuses. That is they all deal with 
the external organisation in the same supply chain, which makes the concept more supply chain rather than organisationally 
internal. These concepts also tell us that supply chain management involves managerial decision making across strategic, 
tactic and operational levels &ndash; the pervasiveness. One may notice that all the major Operations Management text books will 
include a chapter or two on supply chain management, but that does not necessarily make the subject purely operational.

<p>Global Supply Chain Operations
</p>
<p>1.3 Development Trends
</p>
<p>Another difficulty in understanding and defining supply chain and supply chain management is that it is never stand 
still and the subject has been continuously evolving since its inception in the early 1980s. The continuous development is 
partly propelled by the changes of overall business environment and heightened competitions in the global market place. 
But partly it is influenced by the new understanding of the supply chain that they participate. There are number of early 
development trends that can be observed evidently.
</p>
<p>1) From functional to process perspective. Business management used to see and take action on the 
functional silos in the business. It was understandable that naturally the function is what seen to be the 
delivery part of the business. But, today with supply chain management concept managers can see their 
problems more from the process perspective, understanding that functions can only make sense if it is 
perceived from a supply chain process perspective.
</p>
<p>2) From operational to strategic viewpoint. At early years of applying supply chain management concept, 
managers tends to see it as another operational tactics that will help to reduce operational cost, such as 
purchasing function improvement and optimising the logistics operations. But, gradually more and more 
managers realised that the effective changes can only be achieved if the operational issues are addressed from the 
supply chain wide strategic viewpoint. Operational excellence can only be manifested through its strategic fit.
</p>
<p>3) From single enterprise to extended enterprise. Enterprise management is now arguably displaced by 
the supply chain management, where the supply chain is by definition the extended enterprise. The long 
established enterprise centred management thinking was based on that the competition was raged between 
the organisations, thus it becomes obsolete as the competitions are now predominantly between the supply 
chains. Management thinking over the extended enterprise produces a great deal ideas that single enterprise 
alone cannot.
</p>
<p>4) From transactional to relationship based engagement. Business engagement between firms in the past 
was predominantly transaction based and cost driven. The merit of any purchasing and procurement of 
externally sourced materials and services was judged by the transactional measures such as price, volume 
and delivery terms. But what&rsquo;s now more of the practices in working with external organisations within the 
supply chain is so called relationship based engagement. This relationship approach does not abandon the 
transactional activities but put its decision baking on much wider consideration of knowledge exchange, 
long-term commitment, incentives and reward. 
</p>
<p>5) From local to regional, and from regional to global. Connections of supply network have over the last two 
decades grown from local to regional and to global. Hardly any major enterprise and supply chains is not 
connected to some part of the world. You need to get out before you can get up. This trend is spurred by the 
lower cost of labour and materials in many parts of the world, as well as first mover advantages in setting up 
global market presence. 
</p>
<p>The trends of supply chain development are not always positive and encouraging. There is now enough evidence to support 
that supply chain risks are now continuously growing to the level that is higher than ever before; and supply chain integration 
still remains as the major management shortfall across all industrial sectors (PRTM Global supply chain trends report 
2010-12). The task of managing and improving supply chain performances across all industrial sectors is only becoming 
tougher, not easier. This calls for deeper and more thorough understanding of the challenges supply chains are facing.</p>

<p>2 Global Supply Chain Operations
2.1 Global Business Environment
</p>
<p>To date, our world market is dominated mostly by many well established global brands. Over the last three decades, 
there have been a steady trend of global market convergence &ndash; the tendency that indigenous markets start converge on a set 
of similar products or services across the world. The end-result of the global market convergence is that companies have 
succeeded on their products or services now have the whole wide world to embrace for their marketing as well as sourcing.
</p>
<p>The rationale of global market convergence lies partially in the irreversible growth of global mass media including Internet, 
TVs, radios, news papers and movies, through which our planet has become truly a small global village. Everybody knows 
what everybody else is doing, and everyone wants the same thing if it is perceived any good. It also lies in the rise of 
emerging economic powers led by BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China), which has significantly improved the living 
standard and the affordability of millions if not billions of people.
</p>
<p>For organizations and their supply chains, the logic of going global is also clearly recognizable from economic perspective. 
They are merely seeking growth opportunities by expanding their markets to wherever there are more potentials for profit-
making; and to wherever resources are cheaper in order to reduce the overall supply chain costs. Inter-organizational 
collaborations in technological frontier and market presences in the predominantly non-homogeneous markets can also 
be the strong drivers behind the scene. 
</p>
<p>One can also observe from a more theoretical perspective that the trends of globalization from Adam Smith&rsquo;s law of &ldquo;division 
of labour&rdquo;. A global supply chain is destined to be stronger than a local supply chain because it takes the advantage of 
the International Division of Labour. Surely, the specialization and cooperation in the global scenario yields higher level 
of economy than that of any local supply chains. Thus the growth of global supply chain tends to give rise to the need for 
more coordination between the specialized activities along the supply chain in the global scale. 
</p>
<p>As the newly appointed Harvard Business School dean professor Nitin Nohria said &ldquo;If the 20th century is American&rsquo;s 
century, then the 21st century is definitely going to be the global century.&rdquo; The shift of economic and political powers 
around world is all too visible and has become much more dynamic and complex. But, one thing is certain that there 
will be significantly and increasingly more participation of diverse industries from all around the world into the global 
supply chain network; hence bringing in the influences from many emerging economies around the world. Their roles in 
the globally stretched network of multinational supply chains are going to be pivotal and will lead towards a profoundly 
changed competitive landscape. </p>

</p>
<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>In such a global stage there are a number of key characteristics that global supply chains must recognize before they can 
steer through:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Borderless: National borders are no longer the limits for supply chain development in terms of sourcing, 
marketing, manufacturing and delivering. This borderless phenomenon is much beyond the visible material 
flows of the globalised supply chain. It is equally strongly manifested in terms of invisible dimensions 
of global development such as brands, services, technological collaboration and financing. Evidently, 
the national borders are far less constrictive than they used to be. Arguable this is perhaps the result of 
technology development, regional and bilateral trade agreements, and the facilitation or world organizations 
such as WTO, WB, GATT, OECD, OPEC and so on. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Cyber-connected: The global business environment is no longer a cluster of many indigenous independent 
local markets, but rather it emerged as an inter-connected single market through predominantly and 
growingly important cyber connections. For this reason, the inter-connection of our global business 
environment is almost &ldquo;invisible&rdquo;, spontaneous and less controllable and surely irreversible. Globally 
stretched multinational supply chains would not be possible or even comprehensible without cyber-
technology allowing large amounts of data to be transferred incredibly quickly and reliably.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Deregulated: Trade barriers around the world has been demolished or at least significantly lowered. 
Economic and free-trade zones around the world have promoted open and fair competition and created, 
albeit never perfect, a level playing field on the global stage. Deregulation simplifies and removes the rules 
and regulations that constrain the operation of market forces. It has targeted more at the international 
trading and aiming for stimulating global economic growth. The typical deregulated regions are European 
Union, North America Free Trade Agreement zone; Associations of Southeast Asian Nations group and so 
on. Deregulation reduces government control over how business is done thus moving towards laissez-fair 
and free market system.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Environmental Consciousness: Last decade has witnessed the growing concerns on the negative impact of 
business and economic development on the natural environment. The global movement towards green and 
more eco sustainable business strategies plays an important role in today&rsquo;s global supply chain development. 
This is also driven by the actions of lawmakers and regulatory agencies, such as the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA). Governments of leading economies are increasingly involved in promoting 
greening activities in business, and formalize more legislation and regulation to place upon firms in the 
future. Carbon footprint is now a key performance measure of the sustainability for many global supply 
chains. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Social Responsibility: Along with that is a wider socio-economic impact. Fair trade and business ethics 
become increasingly the key measures on business&rsquo;s social responsibility, and the key factors for business 
decision making. Social pressure strikes at the heart of a company&rsquo;s brand in the mind of the consumer. A 
significant group of consumers have begun making their purchasing decisions based on the supply chain&rsquo;s 
ethical standard and social responsibility. Global corporate citizenship and social responsibility forms yet 
another important business environmental factor that can make or break a business.</p>

<p>2.2 Strategic Challenges
</p>
<p>Under such a changing global business environment, what are the new strategic and operational challenges? At a macro 
level, there are at least five key strategic challenges that will have the long term and overall impact on the architecture as 
well the management process of the global supply chains. Those strategic challenges tend to be interrelated intricately and 
dynamically with one another. The magnitude of those challenges varies from industry to industry; and from time to time. 
</p>
<p>Market dimension
</p>
<p>Continuing demand volatility across the world market has hampered many supply chains&rsquo; ability to manage the responsiveness 
effectively. Demand fluctuation at the consumer market level poses a serious challenge to the assets configuration of supply 
chain, capacity synchronisation, and lead-time management. More often than not it triggers the &lsquo;bullwhip effect&rsquo; throughout 
the supply chain resulting in higher operating cost and unsatisfactory delivery of products and services. 
</p>
<p>The root causes of the demand volatility in the global market are usually unpredictable and even less controllable. Economic 
climate plays a key role in overall consumer demand. The recent worldwide economic downturn has made many global 
supply chains over-capacitated, at least for a considerable period of time. Geo-political instability around the world has 
also contributed to the market volatility to certain industries. Technology development and product innovation constantly 
creates as well as destroys the markets often in a speed much faster than the supply chain can possibly adapt. Emerging 
economies around the world are aggressively churning out products and services that rival the incumbent supply chains 
in terms of quality and price, which lead to huge swings of market sentiment.

<p>Fundamentals of Supply Chain Management
</p>

</p>
<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>Recent research shows that customer loyalty has significantly decreased over the last decade, adding to the concerns of 
market volatility. The development of internet based distribution channels and other mobile marketing medias has made it 
incredibly easier for consumers to switch their usual brands. Many products are becoming more and more commoditized, 
with multiple competitors offering very similar features. With increased market transparency, many B2B and end customers 
simply shop for the lowest price, overlooking their loyalty to particular suppliers or products. A lack of robust forecasting 
and planning tools may have contributed to the problem, as companies and their suppliers frequently find themselves 
scrambling to meet unexpected changes in demand.
</p>
<p>Technology dimension
</p>
<p>Technology and the level of the sophistication in applying the technology for competitive advantages have long been 
recognised as the key strategic challenges in supply chain management. This is even more so, when we are now talking about 
the supply chain development in a global stage. The key strategic challenges in the technological dimension are threefold.
</p>
<p>The first is the development lead-time challenge. The lead-time from innovative ideas to testing, prototyping, manufacturing, 
and marketing has been significantly shortened. This is partially due to the much widened global collaboration on 
technological development and subsequent commercialisation and dissemination. The globally evolved technology 
development systems have created a new breed of elite group as the world technology leaders across different industries. 
They capture the first mover advantages and made the entry barriers for new comers almost impossible to overtake. 
No doubt, there is a strategic challenge that global supply chain must create an ever ready architecture that can quickly 
embrace the new ideas and capitalise it in the market place.
</p>
<p>The second challenge comes from its disruptive power. Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen published 
his book The Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma in May 1997, in which he expounded on what he defined as the disruptive technology. 
The basic message he tried to put across was that when new technologies causes great firms to fail, managers face the 
dilemma. Evidently, not all new technologies are sustaining to business, often they are competency-destroying. The product 
or service developed through applying new innovative technologies may not be so much appreciated by the consumers. 
Consumers often are often not so eager to buy the ideas. They may not be so convinced that the value the technology 
created or the costs it added in. If you wait for other companies to test the market first, then you run a high risk of losing 
the first mover advantage and losing the market leadership. That&rsquo;s the dilemma and that&rsquo;s the challenge.
</p>
<p>The third challenge lies in the supply chain network. The innovative ideas and new technologies usually emerge from 
a supplier or a contractor in the supply chain network. To convince the whole supply chain of the value adding or cost 
reduction is not guaranteed. Each supplier and contractor will have its own value stream and will make technology adoption 
decisions based on the needs of its own customers. Innovative ideas that come up from subcontractors may be stifled due 
to the supply chain&rsquo;s inability to coordinate value contribution between individual members and the whole supply chain. 
The cost and profit structures in the value network can also limit the attractiveness of an innovation. If profit margins are 
low, the emphasis will be on cost cutting across proven technologies, rather than taking the risk of the new technologies. </p>

</p>
<p>Finally from the technology evolution perspective, technology destroys as readily as it creates. The development of digital 
photography has literally destroyed the photo film manufacturing industries including many well known brands; LCD 
and Plasma technology also smashed the TV Tube (traditional screen component) manufacturing industry overnight. 
This increased risk of technology disruption at the industrial scale is lot more formidable than the innovative dilemma 
Prof Christenson was talking about in his book. Nevertheless, there are some helpful supply chain strategies that can 
better prepare them for the eventuality. 
</p>
<p>Resource dimension
</p>
<p>From resource based perspective, global supply chain development is both motivated by dinging new resources around 
world and by make better use of its own already acquired resources to yield economic outputs. It comes as no surprises that 
one of the key strategic challenges in global supply chain development is about resource deployment. The term resource 
in this context means any strategically important resources, including financial resource, workforce resource, intellectual 
resource, natural material resources, infrastructure and asset related resources, and so forth. 
</p>
<p>Stretching supply chains&rsquo; downstream tentacles around the world opens the door for making good (more efficient) use of 
internal resources, i.e. the same level of resources can now be used to satisfy much wider and bigger market in terms of 
volume, variety, quality and functions. However the internal resource or competence based strategy will also face more 
severe challenges on the global stage than in its own local or regional market. The challenges are not necessarily just 
from the indigenous market, but more likely they come from equally competitive incumbent multinationals and possible 
emerging ones alike. Also more menacingly the internal based advantages can evaporate anytime when global business 
environment subjects fundamental changes.

</p>
<p>22 
</p>
<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>Stretching the sourcing-end (supply side) of supply chain to the global market is a great strategy to acquire scarce resources, 
or any resources at a much lowered cost. The productivity and operational efficiency oriented strategy is often no match 
to the procurement focused strategy in measures of reducing the total supply chain cost. No wonder many multinationals 
are actively debating on sourcing their workforce, materials and energy from overseas locations in order to significantly 
reduce the operation cost, which will then lead to more competitive market offerings. This resource sourcing strategy 
has been the prime drive for the surge of off-shoring and outsourcing activities all over the world. However many long-
term and short-term impacts of outsourcing and off-shoring are difficult to be fully understood from the outset, if at all 
possible. Thus it forms a key strategic challenge in global supply chain development. 
</p>
<p>Time dimension
</p>
<p>Most of the key global supply chain challenges are time related, and it appears to be that they are becoming even more 
time related than ever before. Given that everything else is equal; the differences on time could make or break a supply 
chain. When the new market opportunity emerges it is usually the one who gets into the market first reaps the biggest 
advantages. Competitions on many new electronic consumer products is largely about who developed it first and become 
the industry leader. From the internal supply chain perspective, the cost and core competences are all largely measured 
against time. Inventory cost increase, if the materials do not move on quick enough; supply chain responsiveness is can 
be significantly influenced by the lead-time and throughput time.
</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the key supply chain management subject areas is about agility and responsiveness. That is basically 
defined as how fast the supply chain can respond to the unexpected and often quite sudden changes in market demand. 
Understandably, in the increasingly fast moving global market place, developing and implementing an agile supply chain 
strategy makes sense. However, the tough challenges are usually not on making the decisions as to whether should the 
supply chain be agile or not. They are more on balancing the &lsquo;cost to serve&rsquo;. In order to maintain a nimble footed business 
model, the supply chain may have to upgrade its facilities with investment, having higher than usual production and service 
capacities, or having high level of inventories. Then the question is would the resultant agility pay for the heightened 
supply chain costs. There is no fixed answer to this question, and it remains as a key challenge to supply chain managers.
</p>
<p>The time measures on many operational issues have also been the major challenges for supply chain managers. Customer 
lead-time, i.e. from customer order to product delivery, is one of those challenges. Toyota claims that they can produce a 
customer specified vehicle with a fortnight &ndash; the shortest lead-time in the auto industry. This adds huge value to the supply 
chain in terms of customer satisfaction, cost reduction, efficiency and productivity. But it could be a huge challenge, when 
the customers are all over the world and the productions sites and distribution logistics facilities are not well established.
</p>
<p>All the challenges in the three dimensions are, of course, interrelated and even interdependent with each other. A supply 
chain strategist must have a sound system view to understand the intricate relations of all factors in the whole supply chain 
and over the projection of long-term. Those strategic challenges have undoubtedly given rise to the risk level of global 
supply chain development. It came as little surprise that the supply chain risk management, which will be discussed later 
in this book, is now one of the hot topics discussed in the academia and business circle alike.</p>

</p>
<p>2.3 How Global Supply Chains Responded 
</p>
<p>Knowing the challenges is one thing perhaps to begin with, but learning about how to face up to the challenges is quite 
another. Despite the plethora of literatures on supply chain management, there are still no universally agreed &ldquo;one size fit 
all&rdquo; recipes for managers to prescribe in order to survive the challenges. Academic and empirical studies show there are 
at least five common approaches that supply chains have survived the global challenges.
</p>
<p>Collaboration
</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you cannot beat them, you better join them.&rdquo; A great deal of global supply chain management activities are not necessarily 
about competing against one another, rather it is more about collaboration and partnering. Inter-firm collaboration 
in supply chain management context is simply defined as working together to achieve a common goal. The content 
of collaboration varies from project to project and from business to business. It may be a research and development 
collaboration which is aiming perhaps for a technological advancement or a new product design; or it could be a logistics 
operational collaboration where the aim is to reduce logistics lead-time and cost; it could also be marketing collaboration 
where the aim is to penetrate the market and increase sales. So, the collaboration is usually mentioned when there is an 
area or a project the activities of the collaboration can be associated with. The parties that involved in the collaboration 
are often referred to as the partners or collaborative partners. There are a number of obvious reasons why collaboration is 
one of the most favourite supply chain management approaches.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Sharing resources: collaboration between two firms helps to share the complementary resources between 
them, thus avoiding unnecessary duplication of the costly resources such as capital-intensive equipment, 
service and maintenance facilities, and distribution networks and so on. Information, knowledge and 
intellectual resources are also very common resources that are shared during the collaboration.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Achieve synergy: collaboration of the two partnering firms will usually result in what is called &lsquo;synergy.&rsquo; 
Synergy, in general, may be defined as two or more things functioning together to produce a result not 
independently obtainable. That is, if elements A and B are combined, the result is greater than the expected 
arithmetic sum A+B. In the context business collaboration or partnering, synergy is about creating 
additional business value that neither can achieve individually.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Risk sharing: a properly constructed collaboration can help to mitigate the company&rsquo;s market and supply 
risk significantly for both parties. Risk is the negative but uncertain impact on business, which is normally 
beyond control. By collaborating on investment and marketing, the negative impact of the supply chain risks 
can be borne by both parties and thus shared and halved. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Innovation: collaboration in technology development and R&amp;D partnering is particularly effective way to 
advance their competitive advantages through innovation in the technological frontier. The logic behind 
is perhaps that when people from different business working to gather, they start blend their knowhow 
and experience together, sparkling new innovative ideas. In most of innovation training programmes one 
can always recognise one of steps of generating innovative ideas is to have brain storming across a multi-
functional team.</p>

</p>
<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>Supply chain integration
</p>
<p>The nature of a supply chain is that it is usually a network which consists of a number of participating firms as its member. 
For a global supply chain the network stretches many parts of the world, and the participating member firms of the 
network can be an independent company in any country around the world. Supply chains are therefore voluntarily formed 
&lsquo;organisations&rsquo; with fickle loyalties and often antagonistic relations in between the member firms. Communication and 
visibility along the supply chain are usually poor. In other words, supply chains are not born integrated. 
</p>
<p>Supply chain integration therefore can be defined as the close internal and external coordination across the supply chain 
operations and processes under the shared vision and value amongst the participating members. Usually, a well integrated 
supply chain will exhibit high visibility, lower inventory, high capacity utilisation, short lead-time, and high product 
quality (low defect rate). Therefore, managing supply chain integration has become one of the most common supply chain 
management approaches that can stand up to the global challenges.
</p>
<p>However, there is no supply chain that is strictly 100% integrated, nor any one that is strictly 0% integrated. It is about 
how much the supply chain is integrated from a focal company&rsquo;s point of view. To illustrate this degree of difference in 
supply chain integration, Frohlich and Westbrook (2001) suggested a concept of &lsquo;Arc of Integration&rsquo; (Figure 3). A wider 
arc represents a higher degree of integration which covers larger extent of the supply chain, and a narrow one for a smaller 
extent. The issue about supply integration is particularly important when the supply chain is formed by the members 
around the globe.

<p>Divergent product portfolio
</p>
<p>A conventional wisdom says that &lsquo;don&rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.&rsquo; It also makes sense in formulating a global supply 
chain development strategy. Translated into business management terminology, the wisdom is very similar to the &lsquo;divergent 
product portfolio&rsquo; strategy. Then it may make even more sense when the global market becomes the stage for the supply 
chain. Two key characteristics of global market are volatility and diversity. 
</p>
<p>Develop divergent product portfolio will make the supply chain more capable of satisfying the divergent demand of the 
world market. Many leading multinational organisations have already been the firm believer of this strategy. They have 
developed a wide range of product or even business sector portfolio to cater for the market needs. Virgin Group, General 
Electric, British Aerospace are just some well know examples. 
</p>
<p>The divergent product portfolio strategy can also significantly mitigate the market risks that brought forth by the nature 
of global market volatility. If one product is not doing well, the supply chain can still be stabilised by others that do well. 
The shock of one single market at a particular time will not derail the overall business. In a long run, occasional market 
instabilities will ease off with each other. So, the divergent portfolio works like a shock absorber and risk mitigating tool. 
</p>
<p>By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet&rsquo;s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF&rsquo;s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world&rsquo;s wind turbines. 
</p>
<p>Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
</p>
<p>By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
</p>
<p>Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

</p>
<p>Develop the &ldquo;blue ocean strategy&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Instead of going for the &lsquo;head-on&rsquo; competition in the already contested &lsquo;red sea&rsquo; a much more effective approach is to create 
a new market place in the &lsquo;blue ocean&rsquo;, which makes the competition irrelevant. This is an innovative strategic approach 
developed by Prof. Cham Kim and Renee Mauborgne in 2005, and published in their joint authored book &ldquo;Blue Ocean 
Strategy&rdquo;. In the book, the authors contend that while most companies compete within such red oceans, this strategy is 
increasingly unlikely to create profitable growth in the future. 
</p>
<p>Based on a study of 150 strategic moves in many globally active supply chains over the last thirty years, Kim and Mauborgne 
argue that developing the &lsquo;blue ocean strategy&rsquo; (as they coined it) has already been proven an effective response to the 
global challenges for many supply chains. Tomorrow&rsquo;s leading supply chains will succeed not by battling competitors, 
but by creating &lsquo;blue ocean&rsquo; of uncontested market space that is ripe for growth. They have proved that one can face up 
to the challenges most effectively without actually doing so. Creating new market space is actually a lot easier than you 
think if you know how.
</p>
<p>Pursuing world class excellence: 
</p>
<p>To weather the global challenges and to achieve long lasting business success often calls for one fundamental feat and 
that feat is world class excellence. Almost all known world leading supply chains in all industrial sectors have somehow 
demonstrated that they have just been excellent in a multitude of performance measures. The world class excellence defines 
the highest business performance at a global level that stand the test of time. Only the very few leading edge organisations 
around the world truly deserve this title. But the title is not just a title. It is the fitness status that ultimately separates the 
business winners from losers.
</p>
<p>To become a world class supply chain one need to excel in four dimensions. The first dimension is the operational excellence. 
All world class supply chain must have optimised operations measured in productivity, efficiency, cost effectiveness, quality, 
high standard of customer service and customer satisfaction. The second dimension is the strategic fit. All world class supply 
chains must also ensure that excellent operations fit to the supply chain&rsquo;s strategic objective and stakeholder&rsquo;s interests; 
and the internal resources fit to the external market needs. The third dimension is the capability to adapt. Would class 
supply chains must be dynamic and able to adapt into to new business environment in order to sustain the success. The 
fourth dimension is the unique voice. All world class supply chains needs to develop its own unique signature practices 
that render positive market results. Such internally unique practice coupled with positive market result is called unique 
voice. This dimension goes beyond benchmarking on best-practices; it creates best-practices (Lu 2011).</p>

</p>
<p>2.4 Current Trends in Global SCM
</p>
<p>Many reliable management researches and surveys conducted in recent years have come to a broad consensus that some 
significant development trends are shaping and moving today&rsquo;s global supply chains. The following trends are mainly 
based on and adapted from the PRTM 2010 Survey results with the author&rsquo;s own interpretation and analysis to facilitate 
student learning.
</p>
<p>Trend 1: Supply chain volatility and market uncertainty is on the rise.
</p>
<p>Research survey shows that continued demand volatility in most of global markets is a major concern to the executives 
of supply chains. Significantly more than any other challenges to supply chain flexibility, more than 74% of the surveyed 
respondents ticked the demand volatility and poor forecasting accuracy as the increasing major challenges to supply 
chain flexibility. Apparently, few companies have strategies in place for managing volatility in the years ahead let along 
implementing it. The lack of flexibility to cope with the demand change is increasingly a management shortfall. In the 
path of economic recovery, this shortfall could well be the trigger for bullwhip effect.
</p>
<p>The fast development of cyber market and mobile media has given rise to the market visibility leading to high level of 
market transparency. B2B customers and consumers have found it a lot easier to shop for alternative lower price or better 
value. The switching cost is evaporated rapidly, and so is the customer loyalty, which adds salt to the injury. The only 
known approaches to deal with the trend of increased volatility are improving forecasting accuracy and planning for 
flexible capacity throughout the supply chain. Best performing companies tends to improve supply chain responsiveness 
through improving visibilities across all supply chain partners. On the downstream side, companies are now focusing 
more on deepening collaboration with key customers to reduce unanticipated changes.
</p>
<p>Trend 2: Market growth depends increasingly on global customers and supplier networks
</p>
<p>The research survey has shown a positive growing trend in international customers and international suppliers in more 
international locations. As a result, more than 85% of companies expect the complexity of their supply chains to grow 
significantly at least for the coming year. The immediate implication of this trend is that the supply chain will have to 
produce higher number of products or variants to fulfil the customer expectations, albeit this may vary slightly for 
different geographical regions. In the main, the pattern of global supply chain is going to be more complex in terms of 
new customer locations, market diversity, product variants, and demand volatility.
</p>
<p>On the supply side, the trends indicated that a more dynamic supply networks stretching far and wide globally. Managing 
those suppliers, developing them and integrating them become more a critical challenge than ever before. Nearly 30% of 
respondents expect the in-house manufacturing facilities will decline and to be replaced by outsourced and off-shored 
international contractors. Similarly nearly 30% of respondents expected a decline in the number of strategic suppliers 
to the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) in order to achieve more closely integrate the supply chain for higher 
collaborated value adding. This will result in more consolidated supply base. This is more evident in North America and 
Europe, but significantly less so in Asia where expansion of supply network is more of the case.</p>

</p>
<p>Trend 3: Towards more cost-optimised supply chain configurations
</p>
<p>Survey respondents seemed confident that they will be able to deliver substantial gross margin improvements over the next 
couple of years. However the gains will not come from price increases, but from reductions of end-to-end supply chain 
costs. Globalising supply chain operations and outsourcing specific functions are viewed as critical for controlling costs. It 
came as no surprise that outsourcing is on the rise across many industrial sectors around the world. Companies are taking 
advantages of lower costs in emerging markets and increasing their flexibility of their own supply chain. The functions 
that will see the greatest increase in outsourcing are product development, supply chain planning and shared services.
</p>
<p>However, globalisation does not seem to have reduced process and management costs. In fact those hidden costs could 
be on the rise when supply chain becomes more global if not careful. Leading companies understand the impact of those 
hidden costs and are taking aggressive steps to identify and manage them. Many are embracing new concepts like Total 
Supply Chain Cost Engineering, an integral approach to calculating and managing total cost across all supply chain 
functions and interfaces. Rigorous cost optimisation across the end-to-end supply chain &ndash; from order management, 
sourcing, and manufacturing to logistics and transportation &ndash; are critical for success.

</p>
<p>Trend 4: Risk management involves end-to-end supply chain 
</p>
<p>To date, risk has become an increasingly critical management challenge across the global supply chains. According to 
the research survey participants, new demands from their customers have played a key role in this development. Dealing 
with cost pressures of their own, many customers have increased their efforts in asset management and have started 
shifting supply chain risks, such as inventory holding risks, upstream to their suppliers. This approach, however, merely 
shifts risks from one part of the supply chain to another but not reduces it for the whole supply chain. In fact, between 
65% and 75% respondents believe that supply chain risks can only be most effectively mitigated by the end-to-end supply 
chain approaches. These end-to-end supply chain practices include advanced inventory management, joint production 
and material resource planning, improved delivery to customers and so forth.
</p>
<p>Leading companies are taking an end-to-end approach in managing risk at each node of the supply chain. To keep the 
supply chain as lean as possible, they are taking a more active role in demand planning, which ensures they order only 
the amount of material needed to fill firm orders. Firms are also limiting the complexity of products that receive late-stage 
customisation. Leading companies mitigate inventory-related risks by shifting the responsibility for holding inventory to 
their suppliers and, furthermore, by making sure finished product is shipped immediately to customers after production.
</p>
<p>Trend 5: More emphasis on supply chain integration and empowerment
</p>
<p>Little can be achieved without appropriate management approaches that truly integrated across all functions throughout 
the supply chain and empowered them to take bold action. However, approximately 30% mention the lack of integration 
between supply chain functions like product development and manufacturing. Integrated supply chain management across 
all key functions still seen to be a myth, with many procurement and manufacturing executives making silo optimisation 
decisions. Nearly one-fourth of survey respondents point to their organisations&rsquo; inability to make concerted actions and 
coordinated planning to respond to the external challenges. This could be a surprise to many that would believe after so 
much has been talked by so many for so long on the supply chain integration, little has been achieved in practice.
</p>
<p>Whilst almost all the survey participating companies have supply chain department, many of them failed to empower their 
supply chain managers to take leading roles in business transformation. Leading companies understand that breakthrough 
improvements are not possible unless the decisions made are optimal for all supply chain functions. For this reason, they 
have already taken steps to integrate and empower their supply chain as a single resource under one joint responsibility. 
These firms are making sure the organisation has a strong end-to-end optimization, and are integrating supply chain 
partners up and downstream.</p>

<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>3 Supply Chain Design and Planning
One of the important issues in supply chain management is to design and plan out the overall architecture of the supply 
chain network and the value adding flows that go through it. This means that managers should step back and looks at the 
supply chain as a whole and formulates strategies and processes that maximise the total supply chain value-adding and 
minimises the total supply chain costs. The key contents of such architecture design and planning include configuration, 
extent of vertical integration, strategic outsourcing, location decisions, capacity planning, and dealing with bullwhip 
effect. There are also other aspects of the design and planning such as relationship posture which will be covered in a 
separated chapter.
</p>
<p>3.1 Supply Chain Configuration
</p>
<p>Supply chain configuration represents how the participating company members of the chain are connected with each 
other to deliver the product or service to the end customer. To an OEM, how many suppliers it uses, how the suppliers are 
grouped or categorised or tiered, where do they geographically located, the ownership and independence of the suppliers, 
the choice of distribution channels are all the configuration issues for the supply chain. The fact is that companies do have 
the choice to configure their supply chains in the way they believe are most appropriate and beneficial. However there is 
no single &lsquo;best&rsquo; configuration for all supply chains. It all depends on the industry sectors, market environment, stages of 
product cycle and so on.
</p>
<p>The evolution of global multinationals&rsquo; network could be an interesting example to understand the relevance of supply 
chain configuration. In the pre-second World War era of 1930s and 1940s, the mostly European multinational companies 
including Unilever, Royal Dutch/Shell, ICI, and Philips were the pioneers of &lsquo;global supply chain&rsquo; development and 
created their tentacles such as subsidiaries all over the continent. Each national subsidiary was permitted a high degree 
of operational independence from the parent company; understanding its own product development, manufacturing and 
marketing. It is a semidetached &lsquo;loose&rsquo; configuration. This &lsquo;hands-off &rsquo; approach was a response to the conditions at the 
time when international transport and communication were slow, costly and unreliable; and the national markets were 
highly differentiated.
</p>
<p>During the 1950s and 1960s, the world appears to be dominated mostly by the American multinationals, including 
GM, Ford, IBM, Coca-Cola, Caterpillar, Procter &amp; Gamble. The configuration of those multinationals with their wholly 
owned subsidiaries took an evolved form. Although the subsidiaries were operated with high degree of autonomy from 
the parent company, the US based parent companies occupies a dominant position in terms of strategic guidance and 
resource support. It was partly because at that time the US was the largest and most affluent market in the world. The US 
base acted as the source of new products and process technology. The primary competitive advantage of the subsidiaries 
was the ability to utilise the resource.</p>

<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>The 1970s and 1980s saw the Japanese challenges all over the world. Her multinationals like Toyota, Honda, Matsushita, 
NEC, and Sony completed a long journey from exporting to globalisation and established a concrete market bases. A 
distinguished configuration feature of the Japanese multinationals was their pursuit of global strategies from the centralised 
domestic bases. While overseas subsidiaries were initially for sales, distribution, and customer support. By building plants 
of unprecedented scale to service growing world demand Japanese companies were able to exploit substantial scale and 
experience advantage.
</p>
<p>Supply chain configuration can also be observed from the network relationship perspective. When the OEM forms its 
supply network through tiered suppliers and tiered distributor with medium and long term stability, it can be called the 
&lsquo;Stable Network.&rsquo; When the OEM does not have many of those long term tiered suppliers and customers, but instead uses 
dynamic and mostly short term suppliers and distributors to achieve high level of operational flexibility and strategic 
agility, it can be called the &lsquo;Dynamic Network.&rsquo; The two broad types of network configuration can be illustrated in figure x.
</p>
<p>In comparison, the tiered stable network has more control over its suppliers and distributors&rsquo; operations than the dynamic 
network. An unexpected misunderstanding in the dynamic network may result in unrecoverable product defects. Along 
with it, there is higher risk in operational cost control and quality standard. However, the dynamic network is much 
more flexible than stable network in that it can quickly form a new network in the supply market to cater for the changed 
demand both in volume and in variety. It also has a better ability to upgrade technology and foster innovative processes. 
Which network configuration is better? It all depends on the objectives and desired characteristics of the network in the 
business context.</p>

</p>
<p>3.3 Extent of Vertical Integration
</p>
<p>Much of the supply chain design is determined by the extent of vertical integration. Vertical integration is defined as the 
single ownership of consecutive activities along the supply chain. It must not be confused with the concept of supply chain 
integration. A well integrated supply chain may not have a large extent of vertical integration (see definition of supply 
chain integration in section 2.3). If an OEM does not have ownership of its suppliers and customers, it is regarded as 
having a narrow span of vertical integration. On the other hand if it owns a number of tiers of suppliers and customers, it 
is regarded as having a large extent of vertical integration. Obviously it could also be a forward integrated one or backward 
integrated one as shown in figure 4.

</p>
<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>In 1930s, Ford Motor Corporation created vastly vertically integrated automobile manufacturing empire the industry had 
even seen before or since. Instead of using independent suppliers and contractors to provide the materials and components 
for the Model T (one of Ford&rsquo;s famous passenger car), Ford choose to produce them by itself through creating extended 
Ford owned manufacturing suppliers and taking over some small and medium sized suppliers. It also bought steel mills to 
produce steels which goes into many parts of the automobile; and glass mills which made window screens for the cars. Ford 
also bought large pieces of land in Brazil and Southeast Asian countries to grow rubber trees that eventually supplied the 
rubber materials for making tyres. In the end Ford can proclaim that it did not really need any suppliers and everything 
built into his Model T is made by Ford. That story becomes the classical case of what today we call the vertical integration. 
</p>
<p>Obviously, the choice of such large extent of vertical integration of Ford Corporation was for a purpose not by an accident. 
Historian and academics believe, the purpose then was to exercise control, capture the profitability from the suppliers 
in the upstream of the supply chain, and obviously the market dominance. Such strategic configuration appeared to 
have fitted very well to the then business environment, when market demand in volume looked to be permanent, and 
low price was the definitive market winner. Ford&rsquo;s sale reached peak. However, large extent of vertical integration has its 
own weaknesses. It was very rigid in its asset deployment, product line modification and introduction, no flexibility in 
responding to demand changes (due to fixed production capacity). As Henry Ford once said &ldquo;Our customers can have any 
coloured cars they want, so long as it&rsquo;s black.&rdquo; This was a statement that acknowledged the system&rsquo;s rigidity and inflexibility.
</p>
<p>In the same period, but on the contrary, the second largest American automobile company GM was pursuing a very 
different strategy on the extent of vertical integration. Under the leadership of Alfred Sloan (then CEO of GM), GM 
pursued a &lsquo;full-line products&rsquo; strategy that aiming to produce a variety of models from small economical version to large 
luxury models; some models for family use other for business. To illustrate his strategy, Sloan once put it: &ldquo;We will build 
cars for every purse and purpose.&rdquo; This is a statement of customer oriented supply chain flexibility. GM saw the market 
was changing; people will not be satisfied with one model or one colour. They demand variety, upgraded new versions 
and customisation. 
</p>
<p>To maintain and further develop the company&rsquo;s flexibility and dynamism, GM not only had chosen to use the independent 
suppliers for many of its materials and components, it even created so called strategic profit unit within the vertically 
integrated part of the supply chain in order to maintain the drive for competitiveness. GM has never followed Ford to 
go anywhere near the complete vertical integration. The relatively small extent of vertical integration had given GM the 
competitive advantage in satisfying the customer&rsquo;s needs for variety. Soon GM&rsquo;s sale surpassed Ford and became the world&rsquo;s 
biggest auto-maker in term of volume. Its world leading position was kept until 2007 when Toyota took over became the 
biggest volume producer in the world.
</p>
<p>The above cases show that a supply chain&rsquo;s extent of vertical integration has always had profound impact on its development. 
To large extent a company&rsquo;s strategy, operation and performance will depend on the right design of the supply chain 
configuration. Nevertheless, depending on the nature of industry, product lifecycle and competitive environment, the 
architecture design of supply chain can vary significantly. Generally speaking, process based industry such as oil industry 
and chemical industry tends to be more vertically integrated; and the technology intensive electronics industry tends to 
be less vertically integrated. </p>

<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>3.4 Outsourcing and Offshoring
</p>
<p>On the opposite direction of vertical integration is vertical disintegration where the supply chain comprises of many 
independent participating members and the OEM does not have a large extent of vertically integrated consecutive 
operations. In fact for a vertically disintegrated supply chain, considerable part of the OEM&rsquo;s operations are outsourced 
to the independent external suppliers in order to achieve maximised value adding and minimised total cost for the supply 
chain. Hence, like the vertical integration, outsourcing is also a supply chain architecture design issue. 
</p>
<p>Outsourcing or strategic outsourcing is commonly known as the &ldquo;make-or-buy&rdquo; decision. Organisations may want to 
contract some of its in-house operations such as design, manufacturing and marketing to its external suppliers. Most often 
such decisions to &lsquo;buy&rsquo; the operation instead of &lsquo;make&rsquo; itself is aiming at a reduced cost. If a Chinese organisation can 
produce the same components at a fraction of the usual cost, it will surely attract many OEMs to outsource the production 
of the components to it. But it is also possible, that if some companies, say in India, may have much better capability of 
developing the state-of-the-art IT software it makes sense to outsource the software development operations to them in 
order to gain the supply chain value adding. The decision and processes of moving any strategically significant operations 
out to the external suppliers is called outsourcing. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>There are two points to clarify from the definition. First, outsourcing is not just a decision of make or buy, but also a 
process that including indentifying the potential suppliers, contractual negotiation, regular evaluation and review of the 
outsourced operation. Second, not all operations that carried out by the external suppliers are suitable to be classified as 
outsourcing; only the strategically significant operations can be classified as outsourcing. For example, to a manufacturing 
supply chain, outsourcing some key components manufacturing operations is strategically significant; but the external 
catering service supply used by the same company is not. That&rsquo;s why outsourcing is often interchangeably called strategic 
outsourcing.
</p>
<p>Apart from maximising the value adding and minimising the total cost discussed above, outsourcing has many other 
potential benefits which could form the prime motive for the decision makers:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Focus on and further developing the core competences
&bull;	 Further differentiated competitive edge 
&bull;	 Increasing business flexibility, thus supply chain flexibility
&bull;	 Improved supply chain responsiveness
&bull;	 Raise the entry barrier through focused investment
&bull;	 Enhanced ROI or ROE through downsizing the fixed asset</p>

<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>Case examples of outsourcing are all around us. Dell is a computer manufacture. In order to develop its strategic 
competitiveness in customised product configuration, assemble to order, and distribution channel transformation, it 
decided to put its strategic emphasis on product design and downstream services. To this end they decided to outsource 
most of its manufacturing operations to Taiwan but retain the design and also vertically integrated downstream channels. 
Another example is the Benetton Group which is a leading edge garment supply chain in the world. It has the presence in 
over 120 countries. Its core business is fashion apparel. But, 80% of its manufacturing operation is outsourced to thousands 
of independent small manufactures. This helped the Benetton group to reduce its manufacturing cost, synchronise the 
supply chain capacity with the fluctuated market demand, and alleviate the bullwhip effects. 
</p>
<p>From an OEM perspective the supply chain is less vertically integrated if more operations are outsourced. Similarly, less 
outsourcing means higher level of vertical integration. Across most of the manufacturing industries around world, the recent 
decades have seen a clearly increased level of outsourced activities, and thus the reduced extent of vertical integration for 
most of the supply chains. This is largely due to the continuous growth of global market volatility which drives the supply 
chains to become more flexible and agile, and the less vertically integrated supply chain offers precisely that flexibility.
</p>
<p>Another closely related concept in supply chain architecture design is called &lsquo;offshoring&rsquo;. Offshoring is defined as moving 
the on-shore operations to offshore locations in order to take the advantages of local resources, and to reduce operating 
cost or create market presence. However offshoring does not necessarily mean outsourcing, especially when the ownership 
of the off-shored operation remains unchanged. There has been no outsourcing taken place. The inter-connection of the 
two concepts can be illustrated in figure 5.

<p>Figure 5. Outsourcing vs. off-shoring
</p>
<p>The types of outsourcing business can be broadly observed in three categories. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Business process outsourcing (BPO)
 - Marketing / call centre outsourcing
 - R &amp; D process outsourcing
 - Engineering process outsourcing (EPO)
 - HR and recruitment process outsourcing
 - Knowledge process outsourcing (KPO)
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Business function outsourcing
 - Financial auditing
 - IT services
 - Logistics services
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Facility and man power outsourcing
 - Capital equipment leasing
 - Free length experts hiring
</p>
<p>Outsourcing is relatively simple to understand as a concept, but is difficult to implement in practice. The debate surrounding 
the outsourcing decisions can be lengthy and complicated. The decision often will involve many factors from all levels 
of management and are intricately inter-related. It is therefore recommended that managers should set up and follow 
an appropriate process to make the outsourcing decisions and execute the decisions. Here is a set of common steps of 
outsourcing processes:</p>

7) Deciding on the relationships
8) Performance evaluation and reviewing

<p>To give managers some hands-on support in outsourcing decision making. Many tools have been developed by the 
academics and practitioners alike. They are very useful to get the managers started to create tools or frameworks that 
tailored to their own business cases. Those tools clarify the decision criteria, visualise the decision progress, communicate 
the ideas, and document the decisions process. Two of those tools are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7.

<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, outsourcing like many other management activities is not without any risks. Far from it, the biggest concern 
of outsourcing is perhaps the risk that it brings about. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Negative impact on company&rsquo;s personnel
&bull;	 Loss control over key strategic design task, sub-system or component, resulting in negative impact on the 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s competitiveness.
&bull;	 Could creating tomorrow&rsquo;s competition
&bull;	 Risk of severe business disruption due to failed supply from single sourced suppliers
&bull;	 Tactical, short term approach to outsourcing may inhibits continuous improvement and long term 
</p>
<p>investment
&bull;	 Intellectual property right risks
&bull;	 Foreign currency exchange risk if involves overseas suppliers
</p>
<p>Therefore, an outsourcing decision and its executions must be regularly reviewed and assessed against those risks 
strategically. The review is essential because the changing business environment could easily make the originally right 
decision no longer justifiable. When the capital or financial circumstance changes like the one in the economic downturn, 
the outsourcing decision may have to be revised accordingly. Internal development of technologies and technical 
competences could also affect the outsourcing decisions. 
</p>
<p>3.5 Location Decisions
</p>
<p>The choice of geographical locations for supply chain operations is another important decision area for supply chain 
design and planning. Location decision is about the geographical positioning of the supply chain functions (such as 
assembly and distribution). It is normally done for the purpose of better serving the customers and further reducing 
the operational cost in the supply chain. Clearly, not all the locations are suitable for the supply chain operations. But 
one thing is assured that when changing a location, many business-related factors change along with it. That makes the 
location change a powerful management instrument. Without doubt, a location decision will have profound impact on 
labour cost, material cost, taxation, currency exposure, financial and legal regulations and so on. These will further lead 
toward the significant changes in business outcomes, supply chain performance, and even environmental consequences. 
</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the operational considerations for the location decisions are not enough for the supply 
chain location design. Operational considerations for choosing a location are still valid and useful, but they are mainly 
the measures of the operations costs from many different dimensions. The operational location design, for example will 
take into account of multiple factors on the supply side of operations as well as on the demand side of operations as 
shown in figure 8.</p>

<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>Figure 8. factors influence the operational location decisions.
</p>
<p>However the location design for the whole supply chain will mainly consider two aspects of the whole supply chain. The 
single operation&rsquo;s location decision has to be made in conjunction with the other operations&rsquo; locations decisions. In other 
words it is the combined effect of all locations together that matters for the supply chain. It has been well documented 
that the total supply chain cost consists broadly two components: the physical cost and market cost (as shown in figure 9). 
</p>
<p>Figure 9. Supply chain total cost
</p>
<p>The physical cost measures the supply chain operational efficiency as a whole. It looks at all the involved cost that are 
necessary for the supply chain to transform the raw materials to the end products for the consumer. It includes the 
production cost, logistics cost, material cost, labour cost, taxation cost, energy cost and so on. The market cost looks at 
all the loss or cost incurred by the inappropriate supply chain market mediation. If a supply chain failed to produce the 
products that are the right quantity for the market at the season, delivered to the right location where customers find it 
convenient to access to, with right quality and functions that they expect, at the right prices that they are willing to pay 
for, the supply chain will make loss either on unsold products or unsatisfied customers. measured by the product delivery 
process (PDP) cost in general. </p>

</p>
<p>The locations decision for the supply chain, therefore, will have profound impact on both components of the supply chain 
cost, which in turn give rise to its importance in the supply chain design and planning. However, in practice, due to the 
complexity of many factors involved, making a decision could be difficult; or rather to justify the merit of one decision 
over another could be very tricky. To facilitate managers to make such decision, I would suggest to use the common 
weighted scoring method as shown in figure 10.
</p>
<p>Figure 10. the weighted scoring method. (source: Slack et.al. 2006)
</p>
<p>Step 1
</p>
<p>Identifying the criteria which will be used to evaluate the various locations. Obviously, the criteria what are chosen must 
serve the strategic intention of the decision maker, and depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the location.

</p>
<p>Step 2
</p>
<p>Establish the relative importance of each criterion through discussion and brain storming. Then assign the weighting factors 
to each of them. The total sum of the weighting scores must equal to 100, thus the scores will conveniently represent the 
proportion of the weight in term of percentage.
</p>
<p>Step 3
</p>
<p>Rate each of the alternative locations against the criteria based on a defined scale. The scale could be between 1 to 9 or 
0 to 100, where 1 or 0 represent the worst possible score and 9 or 100 the best. The scoring is normally subjective and 
hence it is more reliable if a group of people join the scoring together.
</p>
<p>Step 4
</p>
<p>Multiply the weighting allocated to each criterion by the score in each location. Then for each location the overall score 
becomes the sum of (score for each criterion x weight for each criterion). The highest overall scored location is regarded 
as the most appropriate one.
</p>
<p>3.6 Capacity Planning
</p>
<p>Business capacity planning is a big subject on its own. What I am going to talk about is the capacity related planning 
issues for supply chain architecture design. If one observes the supply chain from the spectrum of capacities of each and 
every participating members, then an usually uneven capacity &lsquo;landscape&rsquo; emerges. The question then is that which form 
of the landscape is the most beautiful one for the supply chain. The answer to this question surely cannot come from one 
company&rsquo;s capacity planning, as the landscape is formed along with others. This means supply chain capacity planning 
differs from organisational capacity planning in that it is coordinated endeavour. 
</p>
<p>One can consider a single column supply chain with n (number) participating members. Each member has a known 
capacity Ci. Then a relevant question here would be &lsquo;what is the capacity of the whole supply chain?&rsquo; The answer to this 
question is undoubtedly &ldquo;the minimum of all the known capacities Ci.&rdquo; </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>43 
</p>
<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>One can imagine a supply chain as a piece of water pipe with different diameters at different sections. The overall flow of 
the pipe, which represents the total capacity of the supply chain, depends on the smallest diameter section. In the situation 
of networked tiered supply chain structure, the overall capacity of the supply chain becomes the double layered minimum. 
For each tier i the overall capacity is ; and the whole supply chain&rsquo;s capacity becomes.
</p>
<p>This capacity modelling analysis reveals a capacity bottleneck problem. Thus, to resolve the supply chain capacity planning 
problem, the key is to identify and open up the capacity bottleneck. To work on the other links of the supply chain, which 
do not form the bottleneck, is unnecessary and futile as it will not affect the total capacity of the supply chain. However, 
when one bottleneck capacity has been increased, logically the next smallest capacity link will become the bottleneck 
instead; and it will then become the focus of capacity management subsequently. There are already well established theories 
on the bottleneck problems, called &lsquo;the theory of constraint&rsquo;. In supply chain management, not only the capacity planning 
can apply the theory of constraint, so does the quality management, technology management, lead-time management, 
because every part of supply chain do have bottlenecks big or small in theory at least.
</p>
<p>To carry out the capacity planning in real-world supply chain, however, one needs to deal with it in three levels. The first 
is the company&rsquo;s internal capacity planning and management, which could be understood as the internal supply chain 
capacity management. The second level is the company&rsquo;s external capacity coordination and synchronisation with the 
other members of the same supply chain, which can also be understood as the supply chain&rsquo;s internal capacity planning. 
The third level is the supply chain&rsquo;s capacity responsiveness to the market demand changes, which can be understood as 
the capacity synchronisation between the supply chain and the customer demand.
</p>
<p>At the level 1
</p>
<p>Managers will have to manage the company internal capacity synchronisation to achieve the capacity planning objectives. 
This is because the desired capacity for the supply chain will eventually to be executed and implemented by each and 
every individual participating member of the supply chain. Thus for an organisation to achieve supply chain capacity 
planning, it must also be able to manage and synchronise the organisational internal capacities. This simply means that 
each functional silo will need to be coordinated with each other to avoid bottlenecks or over-capacity throughout. This 
also means to make use of the safety inventories, manage smaller batch sizes and keep synchronised flows of materials. </p>

</p>
<p>44 
</p>
<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>At the level 2
</p>
<p>The key to achieved optimised capacity for a supply chain lies in its external synchronisation. The need for synchronise the 
capacities of each participating member is very simple. It is to reduce and eliminate the waste incurred by the redundant 
capacities and to eliminate possible risks of short supply due to the bottlenecks. However, when it comes to actually achieving 
these supply chain wide capacity synchronisation, difficulties cannot be underestimated. First, a truly synchronised capacity 
can only be achieved when the involving members are strategically aligned and operationally integrated with each other. 
Second, to achieve a synchronised capacity for the supply chain, the participating organisation may have to re-structure its 
assets and even make some capital investment; without a committed long term close partnership, such capital investment 
and asset re-deployment is unlikely to be achieved swiftly. Third, capacity synchronisation can only be a result of matured, 
culturally embedded and technically compatible operating systems across the supply chain.
</p>
<p>At the level 3
</p>
<p>The whole supply chain&rsquo;s capacity must be synchronised with the market demand changes, and market demand change 
is often unknown or uncertain. Forecasting has long been used to assist the planning of the supply chain&rsquo;s capacity but 
with limited successes. The credential of the analytical forecasting methods has not lived to its promises. As the result 
forecasting is either lucky or wrong. Thus supply chain managers must resort to other more effective means of managing 
capacity synchronisation and ultimately the supply chain responsiveness. Last two decades have seen some encouraging 
progress in achieving high level of supply chain responsiveness. Today, supply chains are more active in creating and 
developing flexible capacity and flexible structure through outsourcing, vertical disintegration, virtual networks, and 
sharing and pooling resources, to name just a few. But so far there is no single silver bullet discovered in this respect. The 
ways that industries manage their own capacity and responsiveness varies significantly. 
</p>
<p>3.7 Bullwhip Effect
</p>
<p>Capacity synchronisation has another major beneficial effect. It helps to alleviate the Bullwhip Effects in the supply chain, 
and the bullwhip effect is a very common phenomenon which has many negative impacts on the supply chain performances. 
Understanding the bullwhip effect is therefore essential to the supply chain design and planning.</p>

<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>Bullwhip effect is also known as Forrester Effect as Jay Forrester (1961) showed that this was so by modelling supply chain 
mathematically and he called it industrial dynamics. What happened basically is that when the small demand ripple in 
the market place is felt by the retailer at the end of the supply chain, the retailer will then start adjusting their orders to 
the wholesalers, and the wholesaler in turn will adjust its orders to the distributer, and the distributer to the factory. One 
would imagine when the factory receives the orders, it will have the equally small changes. Unfortunately, it could not be 
farther from the truth. The small ripples have been significantly amplified stage by stage towards the upstream of the supply 
chain. When it reaches the factory or components manufacture the magnitude of fluctuation becomes unrecognisable. 
Figure 11 shows such changes.
</p>
<p>Period 1 Period 2 Period 3
</p>
<p>Retail Sales +10% -10% +10%
</p>
<p>Distribution Orders from Retail +17% -21% +32%
</p>
<p>Factory Orders from Distributor +30% -40% +48%
</p>
<p>Manufacturing Orders from 
Factory +45% -66% +80%
</p>
<p>Factory output +39% -60% +72
</p>
<p>Figure 11, Example of bullwhip effect
</p>
<p>Such phenomenon has been observed repeatedly and reliably through all types of supply chains. It is therefore appropriate 
to generalise it and theorise it as a universal &lsquo;effect&rsquo; model, through which analysis and simulations can be applied. Basically, 
the bullwhip effect has three key characteristics. The first is oscillation. The demand, orders or inventories move up and 
down in an alternative pattern. The second is amplification. The magnitude of the alteration and fluctuation increases as 
it travels to the upstream end of the supply chain. The third is phase lag. The cycle of peaks and troughs of one stage also 
tends to lag behind the one in the previous stage. Those characteristics can be clearly demonstrated by a supply chain 
simulation game.
</p>
<p>The Beer Game
</p>
<p>To illustrate the bullwhip effect in the supply chain dynamics, MIT Sloan School of Management created a so called Beer 
Distribution Game or just Beer Game. The Beer Game is the most widely played game in business schools around the 
world. Many modified versions have also been developed and used extensively, but the one shown in this book is the 
original version. Despite the variation of the games played around world, the key features and the learning points remain 
largely the same.</p>

<p>Supply Chain Design and Planning
</p>
<p>The game is a role playing simulation of a supply chain originally developed by Jay Forrester in the late 1950s to introduce 
students of the concept of system dynamics and its management. The game is played on a board portraying a typical supply 
chain (figure 12). The supply chain distributes beers and has four sectors: retailer, wholesaler, distributor, and factory. One 
or two persons manage each sector. A deck of cards represents customer demand. Each week, customers demand beers 
from the retailer; the retailer fills the order out of inventory. The retailer in turn orders beer from the wholesaler, who ships 
the requested beer from the wholesale stocks. Likewise the wholesaler orders and receives beer from the distributor, who 
in turn orders and receives beer from the factory, and the factory produces beer. At each stage there are order processing 
and shipping delays. Each link in the supply chain has the same structure.

</p>
<p>Figure 12. The beer game board
</p>
<p>The players&rsquo; objective is to minimize the total cost for their company. Inventory holding costs are usually set to $0.50 per 
case per week, and stock out costs (costs for having a backlog of unfilled orders) are $1.00 per case per week. The task 
facing each player is a typical example of the stock management problem. Players must keep their inventory as low as 
possible while avoiding backlogs. To fulfil the incoming orders the inventory has to be depleted, so the players must place 
replenishment orders in order to adjust their inventory to a desired level. There is a delay between placing and receiving 
orders, just like in real-world business case, creating unfilled orders. There are also shipping delays that even the supplier 
despatched the goods it will take time to arrive, which is often the case in real-world. This results in the inability to adjust 
the inventory level quick enough to avoid the backlogs. 
</p>
<p>Clearly, the game is far simpler than any real supply chain. There are no random events &ndash; no machine breakdowns, and 
transport problems, or strikes. There are no capacity constraints or financial limitations. Above all the structure of the supply 
chain is visible to all, which is rarely the case in real life. Players can readily inspect the board to see how much inventory 
is in the transit or held by their teammates. The game is typically played with a very simple pattern of customer demand. 
Starting from 4 cases per week for the first few weeks and then jumped to 8 cases per week and stays there until the end. 
</p>
<p>Despite the apparent simplicity of the game, people do extremely poorly. For most of the first time player average costs 
are typically an astonishing 10 times greater than optimum. Figure x shows the typical results of the game. In all cases 
customer orders are essentially constant except for the small step increase near the start. In all cases the response of the 
supply chain is unstable. The oscillation, amplification and phase lag observed in real supply chains are clearly visible 
in the displayed result. In the period of 20-25 weeks, the average amplification ratio of factory production relative to 
customer order is a factor of 4. </p>

<p>Figure 13. Typical results of the Beer Game (Sterman, 2001).
</p>
<p>Most interesting, the patterns of behaviour generated in the game are remarkably similar. Starting with the retailer, in the 
20 weeks or so, inventories decline throughout the supply chain, and most players developed a backlog of unfilled orders 
(negative net inventory). In response, a wave of orders moves through the chain, growing larger at each stage. Eventually, 
factory production surges, and inventories throughout the supply chain start to rise. But inventory does not stabilize at the 
cost-minimising level near zero. Instead, inventory significantly overshoots. Players responded by slashing orders, often 
cutting them to zero for extended periods. Inventory eventually peaks and start decline again. These behaviours are all 
the more remarkable because there is no oscillation in customer demand. The oscillation arises as the consequence of the 
players activities. Although plays are free to place orders in any way they wish, the vast majority behave in a remarkably 
uniformed fashion.
</p>
<p>The causes of the bullwhip effect are systemic. They are a combination of structured delays both in order processing and 
shipping, over ordering and ignoring the incoming good in the pipeline, under ordering and failing to see the build-up of 
downstream demand, panic and over react, lack of coordination, poor forecasting and so on. In real-world supply chain 
operations, there will be even more factors that worsening the bullwhip effect, such as batching, facility breakdown, poor 
maintenance, inappropriate scheduling and communication, poor capacity coordination, market disruptions and many 
more.</p>

<p>How to alleviate the bullwhip effect? There is no single cure-all recipe. But there are some commonly agreeable 
countermeasures to the bullwhip effect:
</p>
<p>&bull;	  Improve information sharing through EDI (electronic data interchange), POS (point of sale systems), and 
web-based IS (information systems).
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Reducing batch ordering

<p>4 Lean Supply Management
4.1 Origins of the Lean Manufacturing 
</p>
<p>Over the span of circa 40 years time, from the beginning of 1950s to the end of 1980s, Toyota led Japanese automotive 
industry created a unique production / manufacturing system, which brought the industry from the ruins of the 2nd World 
War to the biggest automobile exporter in the world. That system was known as the Toyota Production System (TPS), 
now more commonly known as lean manufacturing. The term &lsquo;lean&rsquo; was first coined in a large scale research programme 
called IMVP (International Motor Vehicle Programme) initiated by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The 
primary concern of the programme was the unanticipated yet strong competitive advantages of Japanese automotive 
industry over that of American&rsquo;s and European&rsquo;s. The key findings of the programme have been published in many books 
and articles. One of them is a bestseller book entitled &ldquo;The Machine that Changed the World&rdquo;, in which the term &lsquo;lean&rsquo; 
is defined as we know it today.
</p>
<p>Lean manufacturing is a comprehensive production management system developed in Toyota originally but later gradually 
refined and improved by many scholars and practitioners around world. There are two major features of lean manufacturing 
that distinguishes it from mass production are: first, increased efficiency through the reduction of waste and error; and 
second, reduced carrying cost of inventories achieved by manufacturing in small &lsquo;batches&rsquo;. The key ingredient to success 
of the system is Japan&rsquo;s highly skilled workforce. The overriding concept of the lean system is about doing more with less 
&ndash; a philosophy for identifying and removing waste across the whole business activities. It is also about adding value for 
the customer and for the business and it is customer driven.
</p>
<p>Lean manufacturing was not designed and implemented overnight. It took long years of relentless drive, continuous 
improvement, trial-and-error, and gradually perfected a system that works best. Compared with the mass production 
system, lean manufacturing centres management improvement on people especially the operators on the shopfloor. 
Whether it is quality circle or total preventive maintenance, it is the actively participating workforce that makes them 
work. Lean Manufacturing focus on the add value from demand. The whole production system is basically pulled from 
the demand rather than entirely depend on forecasting based scheduled production. Product customisation and increased 
scope of customer choices are the direct results. Lean manufacturing develop and make use of employee&rsquo;s intellectual 
assets. Everyone is encouraged to make improvement suggestions and even have the power to stop the assembly line if 
they see something wrong. High commitment, hard working, well educated workforce and loyalty to the company become 
part of the organisational culture.
</p>
<p>Lean manufacturing emphasises the optimisation across organisations and supply bases not just the functional silos. It 
promotes close partnership relations with the first tier suppliers and other strategic partners in the distribution channel. 
It created the tiered supply base structure. The waste between the organisations, often ignored in the past, has been 
identified as key improvement area. The modular design of the automobile has been master minded to fit to the tiered 
supply structure. All in all, the lean system has also transformed the supply chain management which we call the &lsquo;lean 
supply management&rsquo;. This is precisely I am going to discuss in this chapter. </p>

</p>
<p>4.2 Lean Supply Principles
</p>
<p>To understand what&rsquo;s unique about lean supply and how it works, one must first examine the supply chain practice in 
mass production, knowing the whole lean manufacturing system was originally evolved from inherited mass production 
system. In the mass production supply system, the mass producer buys its basic components from a large supply base. The 
supplier number will normally reach 5000 to 8000, bearing in mind that a modern automobile will have more than 20,000 
basic components built into it. As shown in Figure 14 the mass supply structure is very flat. The mass producer takes on 
the assembly of the whole vehicle as well as many subsystems and modules. Thus the level of outsourcing is relatively low.
</p>
<p>Figure 14. Mass supply chain structure.
</p>
<p>The mass producer will design the parts to be made by the suppliers. The process is basically a sequence of one-step-a-time 
from design, bid, prototype, check, contract and make. With this system, when it comes to find and select the supplier, 
the cost will always come first. Whosever can make the same part at a lower price will win the bid. This will often lead 
to a scenario that the suppliers will quote a low price to win the bid and then expecting to raise the price through the 
annual price adjustment. Suppliers will hardly share any information with the buyer other than the volume and price. 
</p>
<p>The consequence of the mass supply system is far from beneficial. Supplier brought into the production too late that even 
the suppliers have better ideas on the design; it would be too late to change. Perhaps the buyer never intended to make 
use of the suppliers&rsquo; know-how on the design of the vehicle anyway. Intense cost pressure from the buyer to suppliers 
are detrimental that the buyer often play-off the suppliers making them reluctant to share production information. This 
also made it impossible for the buyer to estimate the true cost of making the parts. When the supplier has improved its 
production efficiency there is no incentive to merge the learning curve (to share the saving). All these resulted in high 
parts cost and unsatisfactory quality. 
</p>
<p>Over the years the Japanese developed a set of completely different practices &ndash; the lean supply system (Figure 15). They 
can be summarised in 10 lean supply principles that are in stark contrast with what the mass supply system was about. </p>

<p>Fundamentals of Supply Chain Management
</p>

</p>
<p>Lean Supply Management
</p>
<p>1) Supply from a smaller 1st-tier supply base: As shown in figure 15 the lean producer also use large number 
of suppliers, but it manages them in a tiered structure. The suppliers directly supply the buyer is called the 
first tier supplier. It is this group of first tier suppliers that the lean producer now deals with directly and gets 
all the supply of subsystems and modules and components from. Hence the first tier suppliers group is called 
the supply base. The number of suppliers in the supply base for the lean structure is about 200 to 300. It is 
significantly lower than what mass supply system used to have. Using small supply base is a distinct supply 
chain configuration the all lean supply chains have in common. This structure change has led to a raft of 
supply chain behaviour changes that really deliver the advantages.
</p>
<p>2) Develop appropriate usually close partnership: by using a much smaller supply base, the lean producer 
can manage to spare more time and other resources to interact with each and every one of the first tier 
suppliers. This has made it possible for the operational relationship between the buyer and the suppliers 
to become close. As will be discussed in the Chapter 7, the close and highly engaging relationships are 
usually defined by the contents of the exchanges in between. The close partnership will typically entail the 
shared vision and mission, joint design and development of new products, strategically collaborated capital 
investment planning, capacity synchronisation, coordination on JIT delivery and inventory optimisation. 
The contractual terms for the suppliers are normally from medium to long term. The communication and 
engagement are at multiple levels in both formal and informal regularity. 
</p>
<p>3) Supplier selection based on performance: when the lean producer selects its suppliers, price is no longer 
the only criterion, nor the most important criterion like what mass producer will do. Lean producers 
will base its ranking and selection on a number of higher level performance focused criteria, such as 
quality standard, R&amp;D capability, delivery reliability, management system and standard, commitment and 
relationship. Price will also be considered as one of the criteria, but it will always be referenced to the value 
that the company can offer. Details of supplier selection will be discussed in Chapter 6. Once selected as the 
suppliers, the lean producer will treat them as the &lsquo;family member&rsquo; and an open and trust culture will be 
enforced. 
</p>
<p>4) Single or dual sourcing only: Lean producer tends to prefer the &lsquo;single sourcing&rsquo; or &lsquo;dual sourcing&rsquo; strategy, 
not &lsquo;multiple sourcing&rsquo;. Single sourcing means the lean produce will source the product (with unique SKU) 
from only one supplier. This means there is no back-up suppliers and no duplicated suppliers for the same 
product. Compare with the multiple sourcing strategy, single sourcing has a number of key advantages. It 
consolidates the volume to one supplier so that the unit cost can be minimised; the supplier will reap the 
benefit of economy of scale. It provides the convenience and focus when research and product development 
is required; to deal with two different companies for the same product design could raise unnecessary 
complications. It helps to develop close partnership; to contract the product to a single supplier is, in itself, a 
clear statement of trust and partnership initiation. However, there are also a number of risk factors involved 
in the single sourcing strategy. The risk of supply breakdown for whatever the causes could be an issue; lack 
of competition may promote complacency.</p>

</p>
<p>Lean Supply Management
</p>
<p>5) &ldquo;Market price minus&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Supplier cost plus&rdquo;: Lean supply chain deals with the pricing issue very 
differently. In mass supply system, the supplied component price is normally determined by the unit cost 
of making the component by the supplier plus the profit margin that the supplier needs to make. That is 
what&rsquo;s called &lsquo;supplier cost plus (margin)&rsquo;. The problem with this approach is that the supplier&rsquo;s cost model 
is accepted without questioning. The uncompetitive supplier cost could slip into the supply chain and 
compromises the supply chain competitiveness. Lean producer use the &lsquo;market price minus&rsquo; approach. It 
first determine the market price of the supplied component through market research and benchmarking; 
then take away (minus) the agreed reasonable profit margin that the supplier need to make on each unit; 
what&rsquo;s left is the &lsquo;target cost&rsquo;. If the target cost is lower than supplier&rsquo;s actual cost, the buyer and the supplier 
will then work together to lower the cost to meet the target cost. In this way, both the market price and the 
profit margin for the supplier are secured. This also means that all the pricing in the supply chain are market 
acceptable, thus secures the product success.
</p>
<p>6) Early and close engagement with suppliers for NPI: In mass supply system, the new product introduction 
is solely designed by the mass producer &ndash; the buyer; and the supplier&rsquo;s job is simply to make it according 
to the blueprint given; the supplier has no involvement in the design stage. Lean supply system choose to 
identify its suppliers first and then get them involved in the design and planning stage for the new product 
introduction. This way the suppliers will have plenty opportunities to contribute their expertise to the design 
and by working with the engineers from the buyer innovation and new ideas can be generated much more 
effectively. The engineers from the supplier may work in the buyer&rsquo;s site as the &lsquo;residential engineer&rsquo; as if they 
are the same company. In this way, many later stage production and engineering problems can be eliminated 
in the earliest design stage. It is an important part of supply chain collaboration and integration.
</p>
<p>7) Synchronised flexible capacity: In the lean supply system, the assigned capacity for both suppliers and 
buyers are not permanently fixed, because a fixed capacity will either be over-capacitated when the demand 
is low; or it will be under-capacitated when the demand is high. More importantly the capacities of the 
supplier and buyers throughout the supply chain should ideally be synchronised to achieve the optimum 
supply chain efficiency. Lean supply system build on a largely synchronised flexible capacity. The key is to 
have the flexible capacity at each link of the supply chain. This capacity flexibility means having the ability 
to rapidly increase or decrease production levels, or to shift production capacity quickly from one products 
or service to another. Such flexibility is achieved through flexible plants, processes, and workers, as well as 
through strategies that use the capacity of other organisations. 
</p>
<p>8) Just-in-time delivery: JIT is a well known lean approach. It represents the key philosophy and characteristic 
of lean manufacturing and lean supply chain. JIT is an approach to material control based on the view that 
a process should operate only when a customer signals a need for more parts from that process. When a 
process is operated in the JIT way, goods are produced and delivered just-in-time to be sold. This principle 
applies to the entire lean supply chain. Parts are produced and delivered just-in-time to be built into the 
subassemblies. Throughout the supply network, the trigger to start work is governed by demand from the 
customer. A lean supply chain can be conceived as a chain of customers, with each link coordinated with its 
neighbours by JIT signals. The whole supply chain is triggered by the demand from the end-consumer in the 
market place. This system of flowing materials and good through the supply network is characteristic of a 
pull system. Parts are pulled through the chain in response to demand from the end-consumer. </p>

</p>
<p>9) Incentive and reward alignment: Lean supply chain pays great attention on the alignment with the 
suppliers through incentive and reward. The objective of the lean producer as the buyer is not to take piece 
of profit from the supplier, but to work with the supply to get the cost down so that together they build a 
stronger supply chain. The contributions that suppliers made to the cost reduction will be rewarded and 
incentivised. The typical practice is that when the supplier made x amount of saving through efficiency 
improvement, 50% of which will be retained by the supplier rather than become the cost cutting of the 
component to the buyer. Contributions on better design and quality improvement will be rewarded with 
more businesses. This approach not only aligns the value adding to the reward, but also significantly boosts 
the suppliers&rsquo; motivation and commitment in creating a competitive supply chain. 
</p>
<p>10) Willingness to share a substantial part of its proprietary information: Lean supply chain also represents 
a culture of mutual trust loyalty at least and usually within the supply chain. Suppliers are willing to share 
substantial amount of proprietary information with the buyer. This openness and trust not only makes the 
supply chain much more visible, thus easy to coordinate, but more importantly it creates synergy between 
the parties. The value of information increases when it is shared and made use of more widely.

<p>Lean Supply Management
</p>
<p>4.3 Focusing on Cost-to-Serve
</p>
<p>To think lean supply chain is just a cost cutting supply chain would have miss the significance of the lean by miles. It 
would become a &lsquo;mean&rsquo; supply chain if that is the case. Although, cost and efficiency appears always on the top agenda 
when it come to make a process leaner, but the subtle yet fundamental difference between low cost and lean supply chain 
can never be ignored. A slight misunderstanding of the concept could have a long lasting detrimental consequence in 
supply chain performance. In a lean supply chain, a cost-cutting idea can only be acceptable if it passes the &lsquo;cost-to-serve&rsquo; 
test. In other words, the focus of lean is not on the cost but on the cost-to-serve.
</p>
<p>Organisations have been applying lean concepts to corporate logistics systems and the wider domain of supply chain 
management ever since Toyota demonstrated its undisputable leadership position in production management. However, as 
so often occurs when new concepts are applied to supply chain thinking, people can start to have unreasonable expectations 
about the actual benefits. The cause of such unreasonable expectation appears always stemmed from the misconception 
of the original terms and ideas.
</p>
<p>The fundamental concept of lean is identifying and eliminating waste in the material, processes, time and information, 
and adding value perceived from the eyes of consumer. Thus waste is the one to be cut across the management spectrum, 
not necessarily the cost. When a cost is identified as the waste, which does not seem to have added any value, it should be 
rightly slashed. The key issue here, therefore, is to looking for the cost that adds no value. If the cost that does add value 
to the supply chain has been cut, value has been cut with it. There is little justification why should value adding cost is to 
be cut. Toyota&rsquo;s three original criteria for value adding activities are:
</p>
<p>1) There must be physical changes
2) It must be concerned by the customer
3) It must be right first time
</p>
<p>Wasteful activities are therefore defined as non-value adding activities. This is where the concept of &lsquo;serve&rsquo; kicks in. If 
the activity adds the value and the value is perceived by the customer, the activity &lsquo;serves&rsquo; the customer. Therefore an 
appropriate translation of the lean principles in terms of attitude towards the cost should be that to identify and eliminating 
the non-value adding or non- &lsquo;serving&rsquo; activities. Thus, a measure for how wasteful is a cost or a cost incurring activity 
can be defined by what&rsquo;s known as &lsquo;cost-to-serve&rsquo;. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>57 
</p>
<p>Lean Supply Management
</p>
<p>With this measure, one can compare activities to see which one adds more value and which one is more of a waste. When 
the &lsquo;total cost involved&rsquo; remains unchanged, the more &lsquo;Customer perceived value and service&rsquo; received the lower the &lsquo;cost-
to-serve&rsquo;, and vice versa. So, the lean approach is not cost cutting but cost-to-serve cutting, which clarifies the opening 
confusion in this section. Furthermore, the purpose of lean approach can, therefore, be interpreted as to minimise the 
level of cost-to-serve.
</p>
<p>This lean concept based on cost-to-serve can explain why some supply chains achieve low cost by ensuring customers are 
not over-serviced, while others achieved much leaner supply chain by investing more into the operation. 
</p>
<p>4.4 Drivers for Lean Supply Chain
</p>
<p>What makes a supply chain lean? Research and literatures have pointed to six key drivers that will lead to a lean supply chain.
</p>
<p>Driver 1: Waste Reduction
</p>
<p>Elimination of waste is one of the key tenets of lean manufacturing. In the broadest sense, waste can be found from all 
aspect of business activities. It can take the form of time, inventory, redundant process and defects. Supply chain members 
must work together to identify and eliminate all those possible wasteful and non-value adding elements in order to become 
lean. This elimination of waste will have a direct and visible consequence, which is the reduction of cost to the supply 
chain. When the cost reduced, assuming the output of the supply chain remains the same, the supply chain efficiency 
improves and cost-to-serve reduces. It is crucial that waste must be assessed from supply chain perspective not from a 
company&rsquo;s own individual perspective. For example, a company may move the inventory responsibility to the supplier 
in order to reduce its own the inventory holding cost. This may seem to be a &lsquo;waste&rsquo; or cost reduction activity. However, 
from a supply chain perspective, the inventory holding cost has not be eliminated but merely been moved from one 
section of the supply chain to another.
</p>
<p>The emphasis, as discussed in the previous section, must be on the waste but not the cost. Cost cutting, if it becomes the 
driver, can be very misleading and confusion. A preoccupation of cost cutting often leads to conflict of interest between 
the parties of the supply chain; and increase the supply chain total costs whilst trying to reduce the cost in an isolated 
local section. More importantly, the most sinister waste often lies in between the suppliers and buyers and not covered 
in anybody&rsquo;s boundaries. The waste of supply chain resources by not getting the suppliers involved in the early stages of 
product development is often not identifiable by either side. It is therefore highly recommended that supply chain should 
have joint, if not integrated, approach toward waste reduction. Collaborative policies and jointly formed multifunctional 
teams are much more effective in identifying the waste lurking in the gaps of the supply chain. </p>

</p>
<p>Lean Supply Management
</p>
<p>Driver 2: Demand Management
</p>
<p>Managing demand is by far one of most important frontier that supply chains compete in the market place, and there is 
always significant room for improvement. In fact, the performance of the supply chain viewed by the end-consumer is 
largely hinged on how the consumer demand is managed, fulfilled and satisfied. The status quo of the demand management 
in supply chains today show it is not just a matter of a good will or customer minded attitude. It is now a measure of 
supply chain capability which is often facilitated by sophisticated POS (point of sale) data communication system. Demand 
management thus will be enhanced or constrained by the companies&rsquo; material resource management systems which may 
or may not be compatible throughout the supply chain. 
</p>
<p>How well firms manage the demand and demand related information such as forecasting and market signals is also reflected 
in how they view and manage their collaboration with buyers and suppliers. Real-time collaboration and responses are 
highly desirable but hardly evident in most of supply chains. Collaboration, not just for demand management, must begin 
with management&rsquo;s understanding and acceptance of the concept, followed by a communicated commitment throughout 
the managers as well as the workforce. Regular meetings and reviews between the partners should be hardwired into the 
processes. Documentation, such as supplier&rsquo;s manual, could be a great building block.

<p>Lean Supply Management
</p>
<p>Driver 3: Process Standardization
</p>
<p>Process standardization enables the continuous flow to run through the company and the supply chain, which represents 
another tenet of lean supply chain. Flow means the uninterrupted movement of a product or service through the system 
to the customer. Major inhibitors of flow are work in queue, batch processing, and transportation. These roadblocks slow 
the time from product or service initiation to delivery, and increase the material and work in process carrying cost. 
</p>
<p>The process flow concept helps to see and understand the value stream of the production and the supply chain. It also 
represents a shift from the vertical organisational structure and functional silos to a horizontal connectivity of processes in 
a stream of value. This value stream process linked the business activities to the need of customers. This means managing 
the supply chain process flow means focusing on system efficiency rather than activity efficiency. 
</p>
<p>Flow is best enabled when material and processes are standardized across the supply chain to reduce the complexity. But 
the standardized processes can only be achieved through wide range of close collaborations between the members of the 
supply chain. The typical processes to be standardized are planning and production. It helps the supply chain up and 
downstream to have thorough understanding of the process involved. Products and material standardization can help to 
share the subcomponents across the product lines, which will lead to volume advantages, consistency and operational 
cost savings. 
</p>
<p>Driver 4: Engaging People
</p>
<p>Lean manufacturing differs significantly from production systems in its people engagement. 
</p>
<p>To implement lean process and develop a lean supply chain, managers must start with engaging people. This means the 
lean campaign is not just a brilliant idea of the CEO, nor it is the job of executive board, it is task that everyone in the 
organisation must get involved, especially the operators and engineers in the operational frontier on the shopfloor. The 
improvement ideas and innovative changes are often come directly from the people who do the job. This also means that 
ownership of the lean campaign is in the hand of every employee not just a small group of senior managers. Engaging 
people is a near miracle drive for the lean transformation. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 First, by engaging everyone in the company, you have dug into the goldmine of intellectual assets of people. 
Their knowledge and expertise have been mobilised to contribute to the value adding activities. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Second, engaging people is the best way to motivate them. People are the only active force in the business. 
How powerful this force is depends almost entirely how well they are motivated for the common courses of 
the supply chain. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Third, engaging people is the only practical way to change the organisational culture; culture is can only be 
carried and displayed by people. A lean supply chain can be built to last if and only if it is created with the 
embedded culture.</p>

</p>
<p>Driver 5: Collaboration
</p>
<p>Lean philosophy promotes working together and collaboration. Lean supply chain thrives on collaboration. Collaboration 
can take place between organisations within the supply chain or across different supply chains. Collaboration often 
results in shred resources leading to high level of economy of scope; it also significantly reduces the business risks for the 
partners by sharing it and jointly averting it; it promotes technological advancement and innovative product and service 
development. The power of collaboration has undoubtedly been recognised in all lean enterprises.
</p>
<p>How to initiate collaboration from the lean supply chain context? It must start with the top level strategic intention 
from both or all sides. This intention is obviously based on the stakeholder&rsquo;s interest and the potential benefits that the 
collaboration may generate. Initial proposal and executive level contact to draw a broad plan and review all the involved 
factors; then further collaborative areas or projects can then be put into details; finally the implementation and trial 
programme can be launched. However this is what normally called the top-down approach. Many collaboration is created 
from bottom-up approaches. In this approach, practice and experience in working together in the past will have laid a 
good foundation; managers then build on that to expand the scope of activity and formalise the collaboration through 
institutionalising the processes. 
</p>
<p>Driver 6: Continuous improvement
</p>
<p>Lean philosophy believes the journey to improve will never end. If better is possible good is not enough. It does not need 
to be a quantum leap; any small steps of changes toward better operations will be encouraged. Toyota Production System 
itself was not designed and created by somebody overnight, but rather an ultimate result from long years of gradually, 
step by step changes through the continuous improvement processes. 
</p>
<p>A continuous improvement process is an ongoing effort to improve products, services or processes. These efforts seek 
the &lsquo;incremental&rsquo; improvement at a time and over time; it also embrace the &lsquo;breakthrough&rsquo; improvement as and when it 
occurs. Some successful implementations of the continuous improvement have been known as &lsquo;Kaizen&rsquo;, which is basically 
the Japanese word for continuous improvement. The key features of Kaizen are:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Improvements are based on many, small changes rather than one radical changes
&bull;	 Ideas of changes are often come from the workers at the operational front
&bull;	 Small improvements do not usually require any capital investment or major change of process
&bull;	 All employees are engaged to participate to seek the ways to improve their own performance
&bull;	 It encourages the workers to take the ownership of their performance
</p>
<p>4.5 Lean Process Mapping Tools
</p>
<p>Lean approach, unlike many other &lsquo;flavour of the month&rsquo;, has been extremely enduring. After three decades of worldwide 
preaching and application, lean movement is still going strong. In today&rsquo;s business management world, lean method is 
still the most popular one across the world. Over more than 70% of organisations have, to various extents, exercised lean. 
One of the reasons why lean is so widely applied and continues to be the most favourable method is that it has a set of 
practical tools that can be readily applied in almost all business circumstances. </p>

<p>Lean Supply Management
</p>
<p>The tools created originally by the Toyota production systems are called &lsquo;lean process mapping tools&rsquo;. The purposes of those 
tools are to visualise the material flows in the production lines and in the supply chains; to see where the waste is. They 
help to pull together the lean thinking principles and facilitate the discussion and communication, and help to identify 
the bottleneck and prioritise the remedial actions. There are quite many widely used tools that can directly support lean 
supply chain management. Most of the figures of the tools are sourced from the article &lsquo;Going lean&rsquo; by Peter Hines and 
David Taylor (2000).

<p>5 Agile Supply Management
5.1 The Need for Agility
</p>
<p>Having understood the impact and the undisputable success of the lean philosophy applied in many organisations world 
over. Can we come to a conclusion that the next milestone, after the craft production and mass production, is going to be 
the lean production? To answer this question, one needs to first establish whether the lean approach can fit to all business 
environments now and in the future. Researches and literatures so far appear to believe the otherwise. The critical argument 
here is that the lean system was developed from a forecasting based volume production industrial sector where the market 
differentiator is reliability and cost, and today large part of our global market is variety dominated and the differentiator 
is speed and responsiveness. Hence, lean probably is not a cure-all approach after all. 
</p>
<p>The new breed of enterprises such as Zara, Dell, Cisco and Li &amp; Fung are certainly demonstrating apparently different 
success models when it come to responding to customers in a fast-moving environment, where life cycles are short and 
variety reigns. The winners in this environment are those that can respond quickly and efficiently. This renewed competitive 
arena calls for more nimble businesses and more agile supply chains.

<p>Fundamentals of Supply Chain Management
</p>
<p>71 
</p>
<p>Agile Supply Management
</p>
<p>Apparently, the focus in an agile supply chain is on being fast and also on being smart in how you aligning with the 
increasingly demanding customers. But the tenet is still that supply chains are driven by the end-consumers in the dynamic 
market places. The need for supply chain agility ultimately comes from the consumer. However, the customer behaviours 
could be driven by uncertainties caused possibly by the world oil prices, terrorism-related demand change or by the impact 
new technological advancement. The unpredictability is not so much the result of one customer ad hoc behaviour; it is 
combined effect of an uncertain world rippling up and down the supply chain. Often the longer the supply chain the more 
complexity and increased risk of bullwhip effect. In industries such as fashion and consumer technology, the plethora of 
products seem to increase exponentially while in the same time the product life cycles in the market are getting shorter.
</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise that the dominant buying behaviour of customers in an agile supply chain operated environment 
is that of demanding quick response. The known business models of make-to-order or assemble-to-order are critical for 
catering such demand. Hewlett-Packard has long adopted the practice of postponing the final assembly of its printers until 
the exact market demand in terms of product configurations are known. Thus what it produced are almost guaranteed 
to be sold and not over production or redundant finished goods inventories are created. Similarly, Dell Computer is a 
master at assemble to order, and often the assembly were carried out during the distribution and delivery process, so that 
the customer can have their bespoke computer delivered in just a few days. And for Dell, the generic components in the 
up part of the supply chain were produced by the make-to-forecast model where efficiency and low cost can be achieved; 
the assemble-to-order at the final sector of the supply chain delivers the speed and responsiveness. 
</p>
<p>5.2 Agile Supply Chain Concept
</p>
<p>Agility is a supply chain-wide capability that embraces organisational structures, value chain configurations, information 
systems, logistics processes and in particular mindset and culture. A key characteristic of an agile supply chain is flexibility, 
which should be interpreted from two side of supply chain. From the inside of supply chain, such flexibility means 
configurations and structures are not fixed. They may transform quickly as the needs arises. From outside, i.e. from market 
and consumer perspective, the supply chain must deliver timely products and services; and deliver them at the beginning 
of the usually short profit widows; often to be innovative and to be the market leader. 
</p>
<p>Thus &lsquo;agile supply chain&rsquo; is essentially a practical approach to managing supply networks and developing flexible capabilities 
to satisfy the fast changing customer demand. It is about moving and transforming a supply chain that is structured 
around the focal company and its product categories to the one that is centred on end-consumers and their requirement. 
As the Chairman of Li and Fung Group &ndash; the largest export trader in Hong Kong, says that one of the key features of his 
approach is to organise for customer, not on country units that may end up competing against each other.
</p>
<p>The capabilities of an agile supply chain is created and measured from the &lsquo;outside in&rsquo; as opposed to pushing product offerings 
into the market &ndash; the &lsquo;inside out&rsquo;. The strategic focus of an agile supply chain is a relentless pursuit of customer value in 
every part of its fabric. The operational planning of agile supply chain is focused on the capabilities for responsiveness and 
constantly in anticipation of unpredictable sudden changes in demand. Such capability building and customer attention 
cannot be achieved without a cost. Typically, in order to ensure availability, extra production and service capacity need to 
be reserved; this will incur additional cost of over capacity. However, when the strategic positioning of the supply chain 
is rightly set, the gains from the agility are worth the effort and cost. This actually raised an important question. In which 
business circumstances that the agile supply chain is worthwhile?</p>

</p>
<p>Agile Supply Management
</p>
<p>To answer this question, we may do some comparative observations between lean and agile by looking at some most 
common variables in supply chain management. First, we can make observation on the volume and variety of the product 
that supply chain produces. As shown in Figure 25, lean works best for high volume, low variety and more predictable 
operating environment; whilst agility is needed in less predictable environment where the demand for variety and choice 
is a dominant feature.
</p>
<p>Figure 25, Volume and variety observation.
</p>
<p>We can also make observation from some specific characteristics of demand and supply. As shown in Figure 26 the supply 
characteristics in lead-time can be long or short; whilst the predictability of market demand can be categorised into either 
predictable or unpredictable. It then become intuitive that in the case of long supply lead-time with predictable customer 
demand, the plan and execution style of lean model works the best; while in the case of short supply lead-time with 
unpredictable demand, the Agile responsiveness works the best.</p>

<p>More comprehensively, Mason-Jones et al. (1999) developed a comparative analysis between lean and agile by observing a 
whole host of supply chain attributes as shown in Table 1. This list clearly mapped out two distinctively different attributive 
profiles for both lean and agile supply chain to home in.

<p>5.3 Agile Supply Chain Framework
</p>
<p>The comparison of lean and agile, have certainly helped to make some intuitive sense about the concept of the agile supply 
chain. But it would be more useful if some theoretical underpinning of the agile supply chain model can be provided. 
Professor Alan Harrison of Cranfield University proposed a framework (Harrison, 1999) for agile supply chain, which was 
perhaps the earliest theoretical attempt to the framework. The four key components of the framework can be interpreted 
as follows.
</p>
<p>Figure 27. Agile supply chain framework (adopted from Harrison 2005)
</p>
<p>Agile supply chain is about virtual integration
</p>
<p>Agility implies that the supply chain is able to respond to the changes in the local market requirements and much of these 
can perhaps be the opportunities. To do this, agile supply chain must be able to leverage skills, assets and other resources 
across the divisional units in the local region in which they operate. This means they need to establish the shared goals and 
communicate them across the supply chain and work toward them jointly in harmony. The bound between organisations 
created by the shared goals does not necessarily vertical where the ownership consolidates. In fact, typically, it creates the 
virtual integration &ndash; the vertical integration without being so. 
</p>
<p>Virtual integration is characterised by informal and flexible and dynamic relationships between the divisional units and 
different sectors of the supply chain. The governance of such integration explicitly does not get involved with initiatives 
that are specific to an individual business. It does not centrally control the supply chain operations, but rather it supports 
and facilitates larger or overall supply chain initiatives from which many parts of the supply chain can and should benefit. 
The virtual integration also provides senior management with a method for supporting and steering direction on most 
important direction. As the structure and processes have been kept minimum in the virtual integration, and individual 
unit involvement remains fully empowered, the supply chain becomes more agile and responsive. </p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Agile Supply Management
</p>
<p>Agile supply chain relies on market sensitivity
</p>
<p>Market sensitivity means that the supply chain&rsquo;s internal measures, whatever it may be, are sourced directly from and 
linked closely with the external market that the supply chain is operated in. All too often, we see performance measures 
and business assessment are based on the data, information from with the internal operation and mostly generated within 
the supply chain. This will most probably misguide the management and drive the supply chain away from its ultimate 
objective of serving the market. 
</p>
<p>What a truly agile supply chain do in terms of performance measure and operational improvement is to set up a very 
high level of market sensitivity. Such market sensitivity has two implications. First is to the internal performance measure. 
Every measure must be immediately or ultimately linked to the consumers in the market place. This means linking internal 
customers and external customers all to the ultimate end-consumers. To do this, a causal map from what really customer 
care about to every operation the business delivers must be meticulously drawn out. Second, is to quick responsiveness. 
How quick can a supply chain respond to the market change is a primary measure for the agility of the supply chain. 
Its attainment is largely dependent on how closely the supply chain is able to sense the sudden changes of the market 
behaviour. Zara is able to have the market sensitivity because they created process of online market feedback from their 
stores through PDF units. Dell is able to have their market sensitivity by creating a web-based distribution and service 
channel.

</p>
<p>Agile Supply Management
</p>
<p>Agile supply chain needs improved process integration
</p>
<p>Agile supply chain will require higher level of integration between internal operational processes, such as sales, forecasting, 
production planning, sourcing, and delivery. The logic behind is straight forward. When sales operation sensed any change 
of market trends it will trigger a chain reaction of responsive or corrective changes through many other operations in the 
supply chain. How fast the supply chain can react to the market change is dependent on the speed of changes in many other 
internal processes. Thus, it makes sense that the internal processes must be integrated and perform as if they a one entity.
</p>
<p>There are number of things that the supply chain managers can do to make difference. First, forecast by market not by 
business units. The forecast generated by business units often show huge variance and inconsistency. What an agile supply 
chain can do is to create a so-called market lead team which will be responsible to all the forecasting required by the 
supply chain and the business units wherein. Second, set out to create a capability of coordinating the three prime sectors 
source-make-deliver. It is all too easy to assume the ERM system will look after everything. The matter of fact is that they 
don&rsquo;t. Third, managers must link forecasting to improvement goals. This is so because the forecasting is a process that can 
take the market sentiment and give indications as which directions the market is moving to. Business improvement will 
only make sense when it responses to the changing directions of the market.
</p>
<p>Agile supply chain is often dynamic network based
</p>
<p>Looking at the agile supply chain&rsquo;s architecture, managers need to clarify how the participating members of the agile 
supply chains are best connected with each other. As discussed in Chapter 3 the supply chain configuration can be divided 
broadly into two types of networks: stable network and dynamic network. The stable network is a normal form of supply 
chain configuration where the suppliers and buyers are formed in tiers along the supply chain. The suppliers&rsquo; involvement 
in the supply chain is more or less fixed. The operational guidelines are formalised with the OEM. The technical role and 
competence positioning in the supply chain is also predefined. The style of operation of this type of network is mainly 
mechanical in nature that is displayed in its physical functions. 
</p>
<p>However, the dynamic network is preferred by the agile supply chain and it has a set of very different characterises. In 
the dynamic network, the ties between suppliers and buyers, and amongst the suppliers themselves, are much looser than 
that of stable network. Short term contract or virtual relations are more often the case. Some even strategically important 
functions such as product design and marketing can be undertaken by independent organisations at a short term basis. 
Market forces rather than formalised structure are the means by which the parties are bonded together. The network 
relies on more sophisticated information systems with high level of information disclosure between the parties, whereby 
instant switch of connection can be easily established if required by the sudden change of market. For those reasons, the 
dynamic network is undoubtedly a more superior form of networking for agile operations.</p>

<p>Agile Supply Management
</p>
<p>5.4 Competing on Responsiveness
</p>
<p>Ultimately, the validity of the agile model is to be tested, not by a formula, but by the competition in the market place. 
The market place to test agile supply chain is presumed to be volatile and fast changing in nature. The top measure 
for the fitness of a supply chain is responsiveness. Typically high responsiveness cannot be achieved for minimal cost. 
Customers and suppliers have to make a choice. The trade-off can be tough at times. For any agile supply chain there is 
always an incremental cost associated with servicing the changing demand. For those genuinely need urgent service will 
pay a premium. If the customer&rsquo;s demand is not urgent, they perhaps can wait or chose alternative cheaper version which 
is often offered by lean supply chains.
</p>
<p>The unique value proposition of agile supply chains is that they can respond rapidly and with high priority in unpredictable 
supply and demand conditions. To do this sometimes means holding spare or redundant capacity to cope with the sudden 
surges in the pipeline. That is part of the cost the agile supply chain has to pay. Zara has two very large distribution centres 
at La Coruna and Zaragoza in Spain which sometimes may only be 50% utilised. This is not an oversight on the capacity 
management, but a deliberated strategy. Zara management know the cost of redundancy, but they also know the benefit 
and indeed the necessity of having transient capacity available to support their rapid fire replenishment business model.
</p>
<p>The levels of responsiveness a supply chain can deliver do make significant difference in terms of winning the market share. 
In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which swept through the US state of Louisiana in September 2005, one 
of the most affected companies was a major oil company, which lost all of its computing equipment in its service centres. 
The company contacted Hewlett Packard, its regular hardware supplier, with a priority request to replace 1,000 specially 
configured PCs as quickly as possible. HP got back a few days later with a commitment to deliver the replacements by 
Christmas. This was not the answer that the company wanted to hear, so it called Dell which had not previously been a 
preferred supplier and asked the same question. Back came the answer almost immediately: &ldquo;Is Monday Okey?&rdquo; Dell got 
the business won a new major customer. 
</p>
<p>It is quite telling that the supply chain that can respond quickly wins.
</p>
<p>How to create the structured supply chain responsiveness? The most commonly used strategy is called postponement, 
or delayed configuration. Postponement is not just an operational trick, it requires the supply chain to configure in a 
particular way which may or may not be so obvious at the first sight. To illustrate the concept of postponement, we must 
first understand the concept of &lsquo;order decoupling point&rsquo; in supply chain.</p>
<p/>

<p>Agile Supply Management
</p>
<p>As shown in figure 28 the order decoupling point determines how far the customer orders will enter into the supply chain. 
It is the point (marked by the inverted triangle in the figure) beyond which the customer specific order is no longer visible 
to the supply chain. Different supply chains have different design for where the order decoupling point sits. For a supply 
chain that is mainly ship-to-stock, the decoupling point tends to be very much at the downstream end of the supply 
chain; while for the supply chain that is mainly make-to-order, the decoupling point is usually at the manufacturing stage 
in the middle part of supply chain. It is therefore clear that on the downstream side of the decoupling point the supply 
chain operating model is customer &lsquo;pull&rsquo; &ndash; responding to demand changes. On the upstream side of the decoupling point 
the supply chain is operating in a &lsquo;push&rsquo; mode, where one the generic components are produced based on amalgamated 
forecast and schedule.
</p>
<p>Figure 28. Supply chain order de-coupling point
</p>
<p>The postponement strategy is aiming to achieve market responsiveness in terms of producing the right variety and right 
product portfolio at the right quantity, but do it efficiently at a mass production price. To achieve this, the order decoupling 
point is postponed to a later, or as later as possible, stage close to product delivery. The resultant supply chain will have 
most part its operation under scheduled generic components manufacturing, which is based on the aggregated demand 
and in a volume production mode leading to low cost and high efficiency. Reflecting what we have leant about the lean 
supply, understandably this part of supply chain (before the decoupling point) is predominantly lean. Then at the end of 
this lean section, there will be a stockpile of the inventory of those generic components called strategic inventory. </p>

</p>
<p>After the strategic inventory, the orders from customers are visible to the supply chain, and the supply chain operation 
is focused on configuring (assembling to order) the products to satisfy the demand. Because it is driven by the demand, 
this part of the supply chain is primarily agile.

</p>
<p>Agile Supply Management
</p>
<p>The critical design point of postponement strategy is based on the understanding of the market. When operated in an 
uncertain and volatile market environment the actual customer demand on the variety of products is largely uncertain, 
unpredictable or volatile. The supply chain could make all the possible variety of products in sufficient volume to stock in 
order to satisfy the unknown demand, but the redundant products cost will be too high and supply chain marketability 
would be too poor. Instead, the supply chain could reconfigure the material flows and make a more predicable volume of 
generic components ready at the strategic inventory point, but postpone the product configurations to the very last stage 
when the demand is a lot clearer and the specific volumes of each variety become more predictable. In this way, not only 
the specific customer demand can be fulfilled very quickly because all the generic components are ready and only need 
to be assembled to the required configurations, also there will be no redundant finished products because the volume is 
produced in such a short span before delivery that it is matched to the exact demand. 
</p>
<p>5.5 Getting It Right from Within.
</p>
<p>To develop the agile capability for your supply chain, you must start from within. There number of things the organisations 
in the supply chain need to get it right before they can become competitive in the agility dominated operating environment. 
This may include organisational structure change, process reengineering, cultivating appropriate culture, developing KPI, 
and investing in IT system. The top level executives commitment and direct involvement is the transformation is critical. 
It may also down to the right style of leadership. 
</p>
<p>Structure Change
</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, agile supply chain differs from the lean one from its structure to say the least. The structure change 
required for developing an agile supply chain applies to two aspects. One is the supply chain architecture; another is the 
organisational internal structure. It has to be said here that we assume business and supply chain strategies have been and 
will be developed appropriately to support the structure decision making. 
</p>
<p>For the supply chain structure, it all about the organisations external connections and how the whole supply chain is 
networked together. The first consideration is the extent of vertical integration. For an agile supply chain, the broad 
guidance is to have small or narrow span of vertical integration. This will give the supply chain a great deal of flexibility 
without feeling bogged down by the fixed assets. The second aspect to consider might be the outsourcing alternatives. To 
have a network of capable suppliers that can take outsourcing contracts from you, will materially improve the agility of 
the supply chain. The other one to consider is the location of the suppliers. Long distance and poor infrastructure will 
certain impede the supply chain&rsquo;s fast reaction and thus need to be pruned in the network.
</p>
<p>From the organisational internal structure point of view, agile supply chain also demands some structure changes. Some 
historically centralised operation may need to be decentralised to cut the bureaucracy and respond to local conditions. 
Multi-divisional structure may be advisable to concentrate on the product, service, and geographical area and allowing 
units to adapt to local needs. Agile operations would also prefer more flat structures not tall hierarchies. High degree of 
empowerment and less formal rules are also positive factors to the agile structure. </p>

</p>
<p>81 
</p>
<p>Agile Supply Management
</p>
<p>Process Change
</p>
<p>In the agile supply chain, processes are still necessary, but they are fewer by definition. Any process slows down the 
response time should be considered for reengineering. It is likely that some process short-cuts are necessary for the agile 
operation and the level of operational risks may rise. But the top priority is still the responsiveness, so long as the safety 
is not compromised. Ways may be found to by-pass the regulations and opportunistic flair could play a role in achieving 
unanticipated profit. However, this does not mean to create any expansive purchasing or costly deliveries. Quite the 
contrary, the process that drive and support agile supply chain are often the unique combinations of standard or modular 
process which is the key to containing the cost while delivering the service to unexpected demand.
</p>
<p>The postponement process discussed in the previous section is a widely applied process to achieve higher agility. It is also 
important that the business processes are aligned through the supply chain. Thus a coordinated process development for 
agile response is essential. 
</p>
<p>IT Systems
</p>
<p>Agile supply chains are best underpinned by an ERP system similar to those used in other supply chain types. An array of 
additional applications designed to optimise the agile capabilities including process alignment and joint forecasting and 
planning. Zara&rsquo;s achievement of remarkable responsiveness was due no small measure of its IT systems. The centralised 
design teams for man&rsquo;s ware, woman&rsquo;s ware and children&rsquo;s ware are hardwired with the retail stores around the world. Using 
on-line market information the teams will be able to change or creating new designs quickly ahead of the competition. 
Anecdotally, if as few as three people have come to the store and asked something that Zara don&rsquo;t have. Zara&rsquo;s design team 
will take it on and design it for them. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, investing in applications does not necessarily mean investing in large lump of capital equipment. In fact, 
investing in hardware may even hinder the agility development. Hardware is generally rigid and non-transferable between 
markets, once invested it will only depreciate, and it depreciates much faster when new updated equipment are coming 
onto the market. Renting or buying the service without taking the ownership of the hardware appears to be a better choice 
for agile supply chains.</p>

</p>
<p>Agile Supply Management
</p>
<p>Key Performance Indicators
</p>
<p>Agile supply chain will also need a set of its own unique key performance indicators (KPI). The commonly used KPI in 
predominantly lean supply chain operating environment will not fit and often misguide the management. On top of the 
most frequently used KPI for agile supply chains are:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Design to market time
&bull;	 Customer satisfaction and delight
&bull;	 Production throughput
&bull;	 Delivery lead-time
&bull;	 Product availability in the market
&bull;	 Capacity synchronisation and optimisation
&bull;	 Cost-to-serve
&bull;	 Frequency of product up-grading 
&bull;	 Service innovation and flexibility
</p>
<p>Fundamentally the KPI for agile supply chain is the market responsiveness in terms of speed product range and service 
quality. But the detailed KPI for a specific organisation, however, must be aligned with its top level business strategies 
and related with the industry sector and product categories.

<p>Purchasing and Supplier Selection
</p>
<p>6 Purchasing and Supplier Selection
6.1 Strategic Role of Purchasing
</p>
<p>Purchasing function has a strategically indispensible role to play in supply chain management. It covers the sourcing end 
of supply chain management interfacing with the delivery end of the suppliers. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The classical definition of purchasing is: to obtain materials and/or services of the right quality in the right 
quantity from the right source, deliver them to the right place at the right price.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The composite definition of purchasing is: the process undertaken by the organisational unit which, either 
as a function or as part of an integrated supply chain, is responsible for procuring supplies of materials 
and services of the right quality, quantity, time and price, and the management of the suppliers, thereby 
contributing to the competitive advantages of the achievement of the corporate strategy.
</p>
<p>Purchasing management thus, by definition, supports and implements the supply chain management strategies. It is one 
of, or maybe the most important, delivery arms of supply chain management. Often it directly delivers the cost saving, 
quality improvement and fulfils the supplier relationships. Purchasing function&rsquo;s critical role can also be illustrated from 
a simplified income statement: 
</p>
<p>Total sales = &pound;10,000,000
</p>
<p>Purchased Service / materials = &pound;7,000,000
</p>
<p>Salaries = &pound;2,000,000
</p>
<p>Overheads = &pound;500,000
</p>
<p>Profit = &pound;500,000
</p>
<p>Suppose this is a company&rsquo;s profit-loss account for the current year, and the shareholders demand the CEO to deliver 
double the profit in the next year. What can the CEO do with regards to those factors associated with the account? Well, 
assume everything else remains equal, doubling the total sales will eventually double the profit. It is equivalent to create 
two companies. But the problem with this approach is that the sales volume is often constrained by the market. If the 
product cycle has passed the maturity and started to decline, to maintain the amount of sale would be difficult let alone 
to double it. Or, the company could reduce the salary by 25%, which could make &pound;500,000 saving for the bottom line. 
Common sense tells that it is not feasible, and the CEO would not agree as his 25% cut would be biggest of all. Another 
alternative is to get rid of all the overheads costs, which also makes &pound;500,000 saving. However, this is almost impossible 
to do practically, nor agreeable theoretically.</p>

</p>
<p>Purchasing and Supplier Selection
</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s left is to curtail the buyer-in goods and service by 7% which will make $500,000 savings for the bottom line. Now, 
just 7% cut in purchasing would result in 100% increase of profit. This is no doubt a very effective approach as the effort 
appears to be small and the gain is amazingly high. It is apparently the only viable and convincing choice there is to it. 
Who is going to do that for the company? It is the purchasing function. This is why purchasing function is distinctly so 
important to the company&rsquo;s profit level. It is the company&rsquo;s profit leveraging point, whereby a small input can generate 
large output. No wonder we see many OEMs often try to enforce the supplied material cost reduction by 4-5% year on 
year, albeit, this may not be the best approach from the contemporary supply chain best-practice perspective.
</p>
<p>The operational processes of purchasing function can be represented by the diagram shown in Figure x. It basically 
intermediates the company&rsquo;s internal operations with the suppliers, ensuring the right suppliers are found and engaged in 
a process of supply and delivering the required materials, components and services that best suit the internal operations. 
</p>
<p>Figure 30. Operational purchasing activities (adopted from Slack, 1998)
</p>
<p>These are just the visible parts of purchasing function. Beyond these processes, there might more important high level 
strategic decisions to be made for the purchasing, through the purchasing and by the purchasing. Typically, make-or-buy 
decisions, supply base rationalisation, supplier development and etc.. </p>

<p>6.2 Purchasing Portfolio
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the best way to managing purchasing?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is the best strategy for purchasing and supply?&rdquo; Many practitioners 
and academics have asking these questions in past and still today. In fact, there were no shortages of answers to these 
questions in the plethora of literatures even in the early years. But few stood the test of time for its applicability and 
universality. Then there came Dr.Peter Kraljic from McKinsey who claimed that there is no single best way existed 
for managing purchasing in all circumstances. He then published a paper entitled &ldquo;Purchasing Must Become Supply 
Management&rdquo; in Harvard Business Review in September 1983, and proposed the very well known Kraljic Purchasing 
Portfolio model (see figure x). This model had since then been widely cited and referenced across the world in all types 
of management literatures. There are now many modified versions by many scholars which have contributed and further 
developed the application of this model.

<p>Purchasing and Supplier Selection
</p>
<p>Figure 31. Kraljic purchasing portfolio matrix
</p>
<p>Dr. Kraljic&rsquo;s answer to the question can be paraphrased as that although there is no single best way, but if we know which 
product category we are purchasing, there would be a best way to do the purchasing for this product category. He looked 
in two dimensions to categorise all the purchased products. One is the supply risk of the product from the market; two 
is the financial impact of the purchased material. Thus a four categories matrix emerged presenting four different types 
of purchased product.
</p>
<p>Leverage products
</p>
<p>Leverage products are those you buy from your supplier that will have significant impact on the finance of your own final 
product, but it is relatively easy to buy from the supply market, hence low market risk. For example, wood is a leveraged 
product for a wood furniture manufacture to purchase. This is because that most of the furniture they do are made of 
wood. A large portion of the cost come from wood price and the furniture prices are dependent on the wood cost in the 
market place. However, unless it is rare wood which they hardly use, the supply of wood is plentiful and there is very 
low risk of short supply.
</p>
<p>For such leverage products, Kraljic proposes a purchasing strategy of competitive bidding. Understandably, competitive 
bidding will only work if there is more than one supplier. The low supply risk factor of leverage products supports this 
strategy. Alternative suppliers are in this case available and substitution of supplier is possible. The buyer can then benefit 
on the lower price and cost advantages. It is important to understand that the buyer need to do so, because the high 
financial impact the leveraged products.</p>

<p>Fundamentals of Supply Chain Management
</p>
<p>87 
</p>
<p>Purchasing and Supplier Selection
</p>
<p>Routine Products
</p>
<p>Routine products are those materials that have very little financial impact on the buyer&rsquo;s own products and also there are 
plenty to choose from in the market place. Examples of these products or materials are small fixtures, pant, and standard 
components like springs and nuts. They don&rsquo;t cost much in comparison to the total cost of your own products. The market 
availability for those materials is very high and there is no risk of supply.
</p>
<p>For the routine products, Kraljic proposed a purchasing strategy of system contracting plus e-commerce solutions, because 
these products have large varieties and high logistics complexity and often labour intensive in handling. The sophisticated 
computer based system ordering suits well with the nature of the products. Although the alternative sources of supply are 
available, bidding is not recommended. This is because the low cost nature of the materials made the bidding unnecessary; 
and the variety complexity of the materials will make the bidding unaffordable. 
</p>
<p>Strategic Products
</p>
<p>Strategic products are those components have high level of financial impact to your final product. They are very expansive 
to develop and manufacture, and often involve high technology contents. They are not usually available in the market 
place, thus high supply risk. The buyer will need to contract for the manufacturing rather than pay for the delivery. The 
examples of these products are engines for automobile and compressor for the refrigerator. 
</p>
<p>For the strategic products, Kraljic proposed a purchasing strategy of performance based partnership. That is to create a 
partnership relation with the supplier and work together to develop and manufacture the components. The proposal is 
obviously for good reasons. This type of components usually is not make to stock it at lease needs to be ordered to the 
specific requirement, often the components will have to be designed and developed together with the supplier. Hence, 
strictly speaking, it is no longer the purchasing of products, but rather purchasing of the developing and manufacturing 
capabilities from the suppliers. That&rsquo;s why &lsquo;performance based&rsquo; is necessary, because it is about the capability. 
</p>
<p>Bottleneck products
</p>
<p>Bottleneck products are those components that may or may not cost too much in comparison with the total material 
cost, but they must have them and they are very difficult to get hold of. The supply risk for those components is high, and 
the availability of the components is not guaranteed. For example, the small amount of precious metal required for the 
exhaust purification system is a typical bottleneck material. Without it, the automobile will not pass the environmental 
standard and will not be allowed on the road. There are only very few supply in the world that have the blessing of the 
natural resource for those precious metal. Demand is much higher than supply.
</p>
<p>For such bottleneck products, Kraljic recommended a purchasing strategy of securing supply plus searching for alternatives. 
You must secure your current supply because you have no choice, you must have it; you need to search for alternatives 
because the constant risk of cut-throat. The alternatives include radical new designs which may use different materials 
that are not short of supply. This is the relationship setting that the supplier has the up-hand; buyers will have to take 
some diversions.</p>

<p>6.3 Supplier Selection
</p>
<p>One of the mission critical tasks of purchasing function is to identify and select the suppliers. This is particularly true 
when we talk about of strategic components and bottleneck components. In both of these categories, suppliers are by 
no means ascertained. The quality of the suppliers and the righteousness of their selection will have direct implications 
on the supply chain&rsquo;s long-term competitiveness. The processes of going about selecting suppliers can be suggested as 
follows, but by no means comprehensive and universal. The processes to go about selecting the suppliers are as follows.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Set up Selection criteria 
&bull;	 Initial contact
&bull;	 Formal evaluation
&bull;	 Price quotation
&bull;	 Financial data
&bull;	 Reference checking
&bull;	 Supplier visit
&bull;	 Audits, assessments or surveys

<p>Purchasing and Supplier Selection
</p>
<p>Apparently, these processes are mainly around setting and taking measures against the criteria. However, there are three 
significantly different approaches toward supplier selection. The first is based on the product that the supplier can deliver. 
This approach will normally check the product prototype to see if the quality and technical specifications can be met 
and the delivery terms are satisfactory. The second is based on the capability that the supplier displays. It typical checks 
whether the supplier has the design and development capability, strategic investment in technology and skills, and up to 
scratch management. This capability approach is often used for long-term supplier selection and can be done well before 
the idea of component is taking shape. The third is the combination of product and capability selection. It applies to when 
a strategically important new part is to be outsourced to a new supplier. Not only the supplier must comply with all the 
product specific requirements but also should have the capability of making future generation of the products in the long 
run, so as to sustain the supply chain development. Some frequently used criteria for capability filtering are as follows. 
</p>
<p>Assessment criteria on the supplier&rsquo;s capability:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Total quality management policy
&bull;	 BS 5750/ ISO 9000 certification or equivalent
&bull;	 Implementing latest techniques e.g. JIT, EDI
&bull;	 In-house design capability
&bull;	 Ability to supply locally or world-wide as appropriate
&bull;	 Consistent delivery performance, service standards and product quality
&bull;	 Attitude on total acquisition cost
&bull;	 Willingness to change, flexible attitude of management and workforce
&bull;	 Favourable long term investment plan
</p>
<p>6.4 Tools for Supplier Selection
</p>
<p>To facilitate the process of supplier selection, quantitative tools are beneficial. They can make the selection process more 
rationale; they serve as the platform for meaningful discussion or debate; they provide traceable documents; they form 
the factual contents for decision-making. Three basic quantitative tools are introduced here for managers to get started 
on creating their own tools for their own industry and products. 
</p>
<p>The first one is called the &lsquo;categorical method&rsquo; as shown in figure 32. You define the selection criteria first, for example 
quality, delivery and service; then you make three category judgements: good (+), unsatisfactory (-), and neutral (0) 
against the criteria for each supplier; finally you sum up the judgement into a total score for each supplier; the highest 
one will be selected. This method is very simple to apply but is rather subjective. Hence, it is recommended to form a 
multi-functional team to make collective judgements in order to limit the bias from individuals.</p>

<p>Figure 32. Categorical method
</p>
<p>The second method is called the &lsquo;cost ratio method&rsquo; as shown in figure 33. Similarly you set up the required criteria 
against the alternative suppliers. What&rsquo;s different from the categorical method is that it is not entirely based on the people&rsquo;s 
subjective judgement. It makes use of some available data on the quality performance; service standard and delivery 
reliability for instance. With those historically collected data, you will be able to establish the corresponding cost ratios 
for each criterion in term of how much the penalty cost needs to be added. The original quoted unit prices from different 
suppliers will then be adjusted to generate the net-adjusted costs. It then becomes clear that if the supplier selection is 
based on the original quoted unit price, then the supplier C should be selected because its cost is the lowest. However, if 
the supplier selection process takes into account of the suppliers historical performances in the three areas and use the 
net-adjusted cost, the lowest cost supplier is A not C. The little homework of considering the cost ratio has made very 
different choice in the selection.

<p>Purchasing and Supplier Selection
</p>
<p>The problem with the two methods is that all the criteria are treated equally in the selection process. This is not really 
true in real-world business. People have preferences toward different criteria for various reasons. In some circumstances, 
quality is more important than delivery, and in other situations the delivery is more than quality. The third method takes 
care of these preferences by assigning a weight to each criterion. It is called the &lsquo;linear-average method&rsquo; as shown in figure 
34. The weight is a score that reflects the relative importance of the criterion. The sum of all the weight scores is normally 
100. Whatever the judgement score multiplied by the weight become the adjusted judgement score; and then add all the 
adjusted scores together to generate the total selection score for the supplier. It should be noted that the weight can also 
be applied to the cost ratio method, or any other method. In the end, the most appropriate supplier selection tool perhaps 
is the combination of some of those methods.

<p>6.5 Towards Knowledge Based Sourcing
</p>
<p>Purchasing practice and theory never stops developing. It really is a dynamic and evolving subject in both theory and 
practice. Looking back at the recent three decades of purchasing development, an evolution pattern starts emerge. Depend 
how one would like to take out of it; the pattern may be presented in different ways. Here we frame the evolution pattern 
into two perspectives, each of which has four key stages. The first perspective is on the operational focuses and the second 
perspective is mainly on the characteristics changes. 
</p>
<p>The operational focus perspective classifies the purchasing function into four stages:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Stage one can be called &lsquo;Product centred purchasing&rsquo;. The operation is basically concentrated exclusively 
upon the purchasing of the tangible products and its outcomes on the overall businesses. It is usually 
measured in the five rights (right price, right time, right quantity, right quality and from the right sources). </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>92 
</p>
<p>Purchasing and Supplier Selection
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Stage two can be called &lsquo;Process centred purchasing&rsquo;. It is predominantly process focused operation. It 
moves beyond the direct outcomes of the purchasing activities and into the processes through which the 
outcomes are delivered. This means that the managers realised that the processes are the enablers, and often 
the controllers of the purchasing outcomes.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Stage three can be called &lsquo;Relational purchasing&rsquo;. The focus of the operation is not just on the process but 
also on the inter-organisational relationships. The relationship has been taken on as the key management 
instrument to enhance the product quality and technological advances; it also had massive positive impact 
on the supplier integration and development.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Stage four can be called &lsquo;Performance centred purchasing&rsquo;. It focuses on the optimum business 
performances as a whole and managing the purchasing function&rsquo;s contributions to the overall business 
performances. In this way, the purchasing function has been strategically connected to the business&rsquo;s 
ultimate objectives and delivery. It is a system approach.
</p>
<p>The characteristics focus perspective classifies the purchasing function into four stages:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Stage one is &lsquo;passive&rsquo; in character. In this stage the purchasing can be defined as lack of strategic directions 
and is mainly reactive to operational requirements. High proportion of purchasing manager&rsquo;s time is on 
routine operations with low visibility to the supply chain. The supplier selection is based on price and 
availability only.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Stage two is &lsquo;independent&rsquo; in character. In this stage the purchasing may have adopted the latest technology 
and process, but may have not got the strategy that aligned with the competition. Links between purchasing 
and technical disciplines may have been established; performance based on cost reduction; top management 
recognises the importance of professional development and the opportunities in purchasing contributing to 
profitability.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Stage three is &lsquo;supportive&rsquo; in character. Purchasing starts to support firm&rsquo;s competitive strategy by adopting 
purchasing techniques and products which strengthen the firm&rsquo;s competitive position. Suppliers are 
considered as key competitive resource. The supply market, products evolution and suppliers capabilities are 
continuously monitored and analysed.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Stage four is &lsquo;integrative&rsquo; in character. In this stage purchasing strategy fully integrates with firm&rsquo;s 
purchasing function. Multifunctional teams and cross functional training of purchasing professional begin 
to take hold. Open and close communication with other functional departments is hard wired into the 
processes. Purchasing is measured in terms of its contribution to the overall success of the firm.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to notice that the four stages in both perspectives can be broadly matched with little obvious impediment. 
However, it will take a more rigorous approach to declare the theoretical match and to create a new stage model for the 
purchasing development. The discussion presented here merely opens the scope of discussion and hopefully stimulate 
further thinking and debate.</p>

<p>Purchasing and Supplier Selection
</p>
<p>But there is no doubt that the purchasing function has now become a much more sophisticated process and has much 
wider and deeper impact to the business performance. It is moving away from the short-term towards long-term; from 
a function to processes; from transactional to relational; from cost saving to performance enhancing. The picture of 
purchasing in the future perhaps can be described as the knowledge-based purchasing, which is built on the knowledge 
about whole business objectives and stakeholders&rsquo; interest, the knowledge about the suppliers and their capabilities and 
potential, the knowledge about the people and their emotion towards relationship and culture; and the knowledge about 
technology up-taking.

<p>Relationship and Integration
</p>
<p>7 Relationship and Integration
7.1 Supply Relationship Defined
</p>
<p>Supply relationship can be defined as the cross organisational interaction and exchange between the participating members 
of the supply chain. This means that the relationship is between organisations not individual people within the same supply 
chain where the material flows defines the boundary. However for the inter-organisational interaction that falls outside 
of the main streams of the material flows, then it may not be called collaborative relationship or partnership relation, 
but may not be the supply relationship. Supply relationship can be either on the upstream side with the suppliers or on 
the downstream side with the buyers. If the relationship is solely observed between one supply and one buyer, it is also 
called dyadic relationship. 
</p>
<p>One of the most common organisational relationships is what&rsquo;s called the partnership relation. A partnership is defined as 
a specific relationship arrangement where parties agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests. Since humans are 
social beings partnerships between individuals, businesses, organisations, and varied combinations thereof, have always 
been commonplace. In the most frequent instance, a partnership is formed between two or more businesses in which 
partners cooperated to achieve and share business advancement and profits or losses.
</p>
<p>In supply chain management, relationship between the participating members is in fact more a dimension rather than an 
element. This means that supply relationship cannot be understood as something that you either have it or you don&rsquo;t; instead 
it is a dimension from which various different relationship postures can be identified, such as arm&rsquo;s length relation; short-
term contractual relationship, long-term partnership relation and so on. It is almost like a variable that may take different 
values under different circumstances. Then the question is how, in practice, one might measure the &lsquo;value&rsquo; of relationship? 
This is a difficult question. Amongst many known attempts, a relatively more convincing one is that if a relationship is a 
form of interaction and exchange, then a specific relationship can be measured by the contents of the exchange.</p>

</p>
<p>Relationship and Integration
</p>
<p>Since relationship is ultimately about exchange, and hence, so long as we know what has been exchanged in between we 
should be able to pigeonhole it to a specific type. For example, if the buyer and supplier have only exchanged on the price 
and volume of the goods, we can very safely assess that they are having an arm&rsquo;s length relationship; on the other hand if 
the two companies have been exchange their vision, mission and value, have joint design and product development and 
coordinated production and so on, one can safely assess that the relationship between them is close and highly engaging. 
</p>
<p>7.2 Close Partnership
</p>
<p>The traditional supplier-buyer relationship has been limited to almost single point contact of purchasing officer on the 
buyer side and the sales person on the supplier side. The purchasing decision is largely based on the unit price. Information 
sharing is very limited if not at all in existence. The relationship tends to be antagonistic and adversarial. 
</p>
<p>The close partnership relation with suppliers was first practiced in the Toyota led Japanese automotive industry. It had 
profound influence on Western assemblers and is now a dominant school of thought in supply relationships. The basic 
practices of the Japanese close partnership with suppliers involve many aspects of supply chain management.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 First they reduced their supplier basis and form tiered supply network structure. As a result, the buyer can 
then focus much smaller number of 1st-tier suppliers; more time and other resources can be focused on 
them to develop much closer relationships. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 They use long term contract with their suppliers. Not only the long-term contract stabilises the contractual 
relationship, but also psychologically it is a statement of trust and good-will intention which seldom fail to 
entice a higher level of commitment.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Single sourcing is preferred to dual sourcing or multiple sourcing, taking advantage of volume consolidation, 
coupled with greater subcontracting to suppliers. This shift has seen the vertical disintegration of the 
industry.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 They get the suppliers involved earlier in the new product introduction process. Suppliers can then 
contributing their expertise to design and engineering of the new products, adding substantial value to the 
supply chain. Some of the suppliers&rsquo; designers and engineers may reside in the premises of the assembler, 
creating much closer relationship.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 They move away from price based purchasing towards quality-driven purchasing. Putting tremendous 
amount of effort in working with the suppliers closely to achieve the &lsquo;zero-defect&rsquo; target as part of their TQM 
campaign.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 They developed the JIT production system, which require close integration of suppliers and buyers 
production system. Supplier&rsquo;s capacity is synchronised with the buyer&rsquo;s; and the production scheduling is 
coordinated to ensure smooth flow of materials and low or no inventories along the processes. </p>

</p>
<p>Relationship and Integration
</p>
<p>The current emphasis on the close relational exchange represents a departure from the former transactional focus widely 
practiced in the Western industries, which is characterised by the short-term gains and limited communications and no 
collaboration. The close relationship is concerned with long-term partnerships and long-term gains for the whole supply 
chain. It is a shared destiny relationship with suppliers. It is often developed incrementally between the buyer and supper 
over time. Research suggests that the concept of trust and commitment are pivotal to the relationship&rsquo;s success. Trust is 
defined as &lsquo;the willingness to rely on an exchange partner in whom one has confidence. It is thought to be the binding 
force in most productive buyer-supplier relationships.
</p>
<p>Lamming (1993) proposed a nine factors model to summarise the key success factors of the close partnership between 
supplier and buyer, which could be helpful as a benchmark for supply relationship development.
</p>
<p>1) The nature of competition
&bull;	 Global operation and local presence
&bull;	 Based upon contributions to product technology
&bull;	 Combination of Organic growth, merger and acquisition
&bull;	 Dependent upon alliance/collaboration
</p>
<p>2) Basis of sourcing decision
&bull;	 Small supply base
&bull;	 Supplier selection not just on bid price
&bull;	 Single and dual sourcing
&bull;	 Re-sourcing as a last resort
&bull;	 Earlier involvement of established suppliers
</p>
<p>3) Role of information exchange
&bull;	 True transparency: cost etc.
&bull;	 Two-ways: discussion of cost and volumes
&bull;	 Technical and commercial information exchange
&bull;	 Kanban system for production deliveries
</p>
<p>4) Management of capacity
&bull;	 Synchronised capacity
&bull;	 Flexibility to operate with fluctuations 
</p>
<p>5) Delivery practice
&bull;	 Just-in-time delivery
&bull;	 Local, distance and international JIT</p>

</p>
<p>6) Dealing with price changes
&bull;	 Price reductions based on cost reductions
&bull;	 Joint efforts form a key part of information exchange in lean supply
&bull;	 There is a combination of working pressure and co-operation, coupled with transparency in costing
</p>
<p>7) Attitude to quality
&bull;	 Supplier vetting system become redundant
&bull;	 Mutual agreement on quality targets
&bull;	 Continual interaction and Kaizen
&bull;	 Perfect quality as a goal (such as 6σ, and zero-defects)
</p>
<p>8) Role of R&amp;D
&bull;	 Integrated assembler and supplier
&bull;	 Long-term development of components system
</p>
<p>9) Level of pressure
&bull;	 Very high for both customer and supplier
&bull;	 Self-imposed
&bull;	 Not culturally specific

</p>
<p>7.3 Strategic Alliance
</p>
<p>Strategic alliance is defined as an informal or formal arrangement between two or more companies with a common 
business objective. They are seen as a manifestation of inter-organisational cooperative strategies that entails pooling of 
skills and resources by the alliance partners in order to achieve one or more goals linked to the strategic objectives of the 
cooperating firms. They usually will take one of the three structural types:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Horizontal alliance: that is between companies on the same level of different supply chains, which is also 
referred to as inter-channel alliances.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Vertical alliance: that is between the firms on the different levels of the same supply chain, which also 
referred to as the intra-channel alliances.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Lateral alliance: that is developed between the client company and logistics service provider firms. Those 
logistics providers usually will serve many different supply chains and thus they are often seen from any 
supply chain as the &lsquo;lateral&rsquo; rather than internal.
</p>
<p>Companies embarked on the business of strategic alliances do so for many reasons:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Sharing complementary resources
&bull;	 Sharing market risks
&bull;	 Achieve economy of scale and economy of scope
&bull;	 Joint development and collaboration
&bull;	 Create value through synergy as the partners achieve mutually benefit gains that neither would be able to 
</p>
<p>achieve individually
&bull;	 Cost saving and customer value adding
</p>
<p>Strategic alliances between businesses usually do not start by the &lsquo;love at the first sight&rsquo;. They must be contemplated and 
planned dispassionately, and they call for a continuous process of initiation and development. Statistics show that 70% of 
newly created strategic alliances decease within one year of operation. This may not be as alarming as it sounds. Alliances, 
perhaps, are supposed to be so. Strategic alliance is fundamentally informal to start with and will certainly enjoy a cosy 
but flexible relationship. It is perfectly alright for the parties to decease the alliance without costing them an arm or leg 
if the experience is not what was expected. </p>

<p>Figure 35. Continuous processes of alliance development
</p>
<p>As illustrated in the diagram, the starting point is the matching of the strategic intent of both parties, which is based on 
their careful analysis and decisions in respect to the strategic choice and supply chain configuration at a high level. The 
strategic intention of alliance can only become the reality when the agreed alliance is implemented and put to practice. 
But the implementation is usually facilitated, affected, or constrained by many factors (the 4 Cs, in the model) including 
the whether the two parties have compatible goals, cooperative culture, complementary skills and commensurate risks. 
If all goes well the alliance is expected to produce some positive result through synergy; and they are usually evaluated 
on the value-adding, efficiency and effectiveness, cost, and shred risks. The evaluated results of the alliance will then be 
reviewed to see if they have met both parties&rsquo; strategic intentions. That completes the cycle of alliance development model. 
It is anticipated that continuing success of the alliance will rely on the continuing process of those described steps. 
</p>
<p>7.4 Relationship Dilemma
</p>
<p>Why close partnership is so great? We ask this question because the validity of the close partnership appears to have not 
been challenged, and most of the times it has been pursued as a best practice almost religiously. Most of supply chain 
relationship literatures appear to be in the same vein; practitioner world zealously follow the close partnership as the 
principal developed from the lean supply chain model. The resultant phenomenon is that we all choose to practice the 
close partnership without questioning its merit in all circumstances, and that could be dangerous. Here, we are going to 
investigate the three relationship dilemmas in order to have more thorough understanding of the issue.</p>

</p>
<p>Dilemma No.1 
</p>
<p>Relationship could often run into a dilemma between cooperation of and non-cooperation. The well known prisoner&rsquo;s 
dilemma game (figure x)vividly illustrates this phenomenon. Two suspects are arrested by the police. The police have 
insufficient evidence for a conviction, and, having separated the prisoners, visit each of them to offer the same deal. If 
one testifies for the prosecution against the other (defects) and the other remains silent (cooperates), the defector goes 
free and the silent accomplice receives the full one-year sentence. If both remain silent, both prisoners are sentenced to 
only one month in jail for a minor charge. If each betrays the other, each receives a three-month sentence. Each prisoner 
must choose to betray the other or to remain silent. Each one is assured that the other would not know about the betrayal 
before the end of the investigation. How should the prisoners act? 
</p>
<p>Figure 36. Prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma
</p>
<p>The prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma is a fundamental problem in game theory that demonstrates why two people might not cooperate 
even if it is in both their best interests to do so. In this game, as in most game theory, the only concern of each individual 
player (prisoner) is maximizing his or her own payoff, without any concern for the other player&rsquo;s payoff. The unique 
equilibrium for this game is that the rational choice leads the two players to both play defect, even though each player&rsquo;s 
individual reward would be greater if they both played cooperatively. This scenario of dilemma does sound very familiar 
in supplier buyer relationship. The trust may leave the business vulnerable to the onslaught of betrayal; but the betrayal 
will surely destroy the collaboration, that&rsquo;s the dilemma. 
</p>
<p>Dilemma No.2 
</p>
<p>Relationship-based supply chain collaboration and integration often run into the dilemma between positive gains and 
negative constraint from the same loyalty and closeness of the relationship. A well-developed, high-involvement supplier 
buyer relationship is at the heart of a supply chain&rsquo;s survival and is the basis of its growth and development. This is because 
the close relationship cultivates a culture of trust, creates synergy in collaboration and ensures operational efficiency. </p>

</p>
<p>Relationship and Integration
</p>
<p>But the high-involvement relationship also ties the company into its current ways of operating and restricts its capacity 
to change. The close partnerships are designed to be got rid of very easily. Trusted commitment is for the long-term. Cut 
short of close relationship unilaterally could be seen as a moral betrayal, and losing face is even harder to accept. Supplier 
buyer close relationship is, therefore for a company, both a powerful driver for development and the cage that imprisons 
it. The existing close relationship with the buyer, and the psychological commitment to it, could be a major constraint 
for the supply chain to engage with better suppliers when opportunities arise.
</p>
<p>Dilemma No.3 
</p>
<p>Relationship development will always have the dilemma between the level of commitment or cost on relationship and the 
level of benefit gained from the close partnership. The commitment and cost is the investment the company has to make 
in order to get closer with its supplier, which include all the activities and expenditures associated with it; and the benefit 
is everything and anything that contribute to the stakeholders&rsquo; interests. Shown in figure 37, the benefit-gain (indicated by 
the blue line) from the supplier buyer relationship increases when the relationship gets closer, this is proven by numerous 
business cases. However, when the relationship gets too close, the gain of benefits may not continue to rise proportionally 
(the blue line dips a little at the end). 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the cost including all the invested commitment, time and money increase all the way when the relationship 
gets closer. The high level of engagement in all sorts of activities incurs costs (as shown by the green line). Combining 
the benefit curve and cost curve together, i.e. take the costs away from the benefit we arrive at a economics model for 
relationships. This model shown by the orange line depicted the cost and benefit dilemma in determining the level of 
engagement or the closeness of supplier and buyer relationship. Three key rules can be derived from the model: 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The closer the more cost; are you prepare to pay or commit to the relationship? 
&bull;	 Over certain level of closeness the cost will surpass the benefit, and become uneconomical; never over-kill; 
</p>
<p>enthusiasm must be tamed by reason. 
&bull;	 There always be an optimum level of closeness in the economic zone, where the effectiveness (benefit over 
</p>
<p>cost) is at its highest.</p>

<p>Relationship and Integration
</p>
<p>7.5 Supply Chain Integration 
</p>
<p>Close relationship between the members of the supply chain is an indispensible part of the supply chain integration, and 
supply chain integration is an indispensible part of business success. I firm needs to develop effective coordination within 
and beyond its boundaries in order to maximise the potential for converting competitive advantage into profitability. 
That basically is what supply chain integration is all about. Conceptually, supply chain integration means that the legally 
independent participating firms coordinate seamlessly together as if they one company in order to achieve the common goal. 
</p>
<p>An integrated supply chain will coordinate the order fulfilment to match actual consumption at the end of the supply 
chain, and synchronise the suppliers&rsquo; production to ensure the timely delivery of the products to the right place at the 
right time and with the right price. Wal-Mart, for instance, shares point-of-sales data including sales and stocking data 
with its key suppliers. Tracking daily sales enables the suppliers to differentiate popular from slow-moving items and to 
respond quickly either to replenish or to discontinue the items in retail stores. Tight coordination between Wal-Mart and 
its key suppliers dramatically increases product availability and reduces inventory costs.
</p>
<p>The figure 38 shows a framework of supply chain integration. It looks at the product flow that goes through a typical 
supply chain, which has the manufacturer as the focal company in the middle, involving two tiers of suppliers upstream 
and two tiers of customers downstream. On top of everything else, the information flow through the supply chain is the 
essential infrastructure for the integration. The contents of the integration are managed through 8 dimensions.

<p>Figure 38. Supply chain integration framework
</p>
<p>Coordination among independent firms, such as raw-material suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, third-party logistics 
providers and retailers, is the key to attaining the flexibility necessary to enable them to progressively improve supply 
chain processes in response to rapidly changing market conditions. Poor coordination among the chain members can 
cause dysfunctional operational performance. Some of the negative consequences of poor coordination include inventory 
costs, longer delivery times, higher transportation costs, higher levels of loss and damage, and lowered customer service.
</p>
<p>Since the supply chain members are largely independent, the changes that occur in any of them are likely to affect the 
performance of the others and the supply chain as a whole. The performance of the supply chain thus is always the 
&lsquo;integrated&rsquo; performance, with or without management influence, i.e. the supply chain is inter-linked one way or the other 
albeit very complex. However, to improve the overall supply chain performance to a desired level, a coordinated effort 
must be taken. A coordinated action not only has proven useful, but perhaps is the only effective approach to mitigate 
demand variability and excess inventories in the process. 
</p>
<p>If supply chain integration is about the process of planning, executing and controlling the interdependence of activities 
carried out by different supply chain members or business units in order to create value for the end consumer, then supply 
chain management is basically managing the supply chain integration.</p>

<p>The Future Challenges
</p>
<p>8 The Future Challenges
What&rsquo;s the future holds for supply chain management? The future of supply chain management is the future of the business 
management when there will be no business that is not part of a supply chain. The paradigm of business management will 
soon be converged to the paradigm of supply chain management. To precisely fortune-tell the future of supply chains is 
meaningless. But what&rsquo;s useful is to identify and explore some challenges that we better prepare ourselves for. Three key 
challenges have been identified and discussed here.
</p>
<p>8.1 Creating Customer Centric Supply Chain
</p>
<p>The first challenge that the supply chain managers are facing is to transform the supply chains from supplier-centric to 
customer-centric. Traditionally, supply chains have been developed from factory outwards so that the company&rsquo;s business 
model may be continued without major change. The management emphasis was on how to ensure the production process 
could be most efficiently run and products could be most cost effectively distributed. The marketing is to find the customer 
that fit to the products rather than to make the products that fit to the market.
</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s highly competitive global market place, the market favours whichever the supply chain that satisfies them 
best. The strategic aim of the supply chains must be on the higher levels of customer responsiveness. Thus the agility 
rather than the cost becomes the key diver. The supply chains must be designed to get the customer on the driving seat. 
Coordination and operational integration of the supply chain members must be significantly strengthened to counter-
balance the increased volatility of market behaviour. 
</p>
<p>It is anticipated that there will be a culture change towards the 21st Century supply chain management. This change, which 
is already underway, is expected to transform the business model from supplier centric to customer centric. The customer 
centricity idea represents a renewed paradigm that will have profound implications through every aspect of supply chain 
management. Research shows that close connectivity to customer will significantly improve supply chain effectiveness 
and market performance. 
</p>
<p>Traditionally, this task of customer connection is left to only small part of the supply chain. Dealers and service/repair 
shops have most information about the consumer, with OEMs and suppliers having the least. However, in future&rsquo;s supply 
chain, more information is shared across the network. With online communities, embedded systems, connected online 
configuration and ordering the future supply chain will have more information about consumers than ever before. More 
importantly, it will have better intelligent analytics to synthesize and use the information. Across industries, demand 
planning with customers in the centre will become a standard process for synchronizing supply and demand. Customer 
centricity also will play a pivotal role in customer collaboration on product innovation. Already more and more supply chains 
support customer product configuration and specification, and collaborate extensively with customers on product design.
</p>
<p>While many models of organizational effectiveness can be used for transforming the organisation, one that has persisted is 
the McKinsey 7S framework. Developed in the early 1980s by Tom Peters and Robert Waterman, two consultants working 
at the McKinsey &amp; Company consulting firm, the basic premise of the model is that there are seven internal aspects of 
an organization that need to be aligned if it is to be successful.</p>

</p>
<p>The Future Challenges
</p>
<p>Three of those are what they call the &ldquo;Hard&rdquo; elements and four are &ldquo;Soft&rdquo; ones. The &ldquo;hard&rdquo; elements are easier to define or 
identify. The management can directly influence them. These are strategy statements; organization charts and reporting 
lines; and formal processes and IT systems. The &ldquo;soft&rdquo; elements, on the other hand, can be more difficult to describe, and 
are less tangible and more influenced by culture. However, these soft elements are as important as the hard elements if 
the organization is going to be successful.

<p>Fundamentals of Supply Chain Management
</p>
<p>107 
</p>
<p>The Future Challenges
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at each of the elements specifically to see how a customer-centric supply chain can be achieved:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Strategy: from the top of the organisation a customer oriented strategy must be drawn and put to be 
communicated throughout the organisation. The strategy must include how the organisation should align 
its strategy with the suppliers and customers to have the visibility and responsiveness to the end-consumers&rsquo; 
demand.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Structure: For the organisation, horizontal dynamic structure that aligned to products and market segment 
is more preferred that the vertical hierarchical reporting lines; for the supply chain, networked flexible 
structure with small span of vertical integration is more responsive to the customer demand.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Systems: the procedures and daily activities must be in tune with market sentiment; customer complaints 
and request must be dealt with by a fixed routine procedure systematically; a joint forecasting and new 
product introduction process should be established collaboratively across the supply chain.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Shared value: customer service and customer value must be enshrined in the core organisational value; it 
should become the culture and second nature for people to act on anything relate to the customer and end-
consumer at the highest priority. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Style: the leadership style adopted must fit the culture of customer orientation and customer-centric. 
The leaders and management team should &lsquo;walk the talk&rsquo; and become the role model in caring about the 
customer.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Staff: the employee and their capabilities are the assets of the organisation. People are the only active force in 
caring and serving the customer. The change of organisational performance is almost entirely dependent on 
the changes of people&rsquo;s understanding, knowledge and attitude.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Skills: the quality of the products, the level of customer satisfaction, rely on the skills of the workforce, 
which in turn determines the organisation&rsquo;s and supply chain&rsquo;s competences in delivering the products and 
services.
</p>
<p>8.2 Managing Supply Networks
</p>
<p>The second challenge is to take on the whole supply network and manage it as an integrated entity. Managers see the 
only legitimate platform for them to exercise control is their own organisation, beyond which is the supply chain they 
participated. This limited scope of business management is to be and has already been challenged. Companies will not 
stand alone in the competition. Like it or not the competition will only be waged with supply chain against supply chain. 
The survival of the supply chain is the survival of the organisations in it. </p>

<p>Fundamentals of Supply Chain Management
</p>
<p>108 
</p>
<p>The Future Challenges
</p>
<p>Therefore the new competitive paradigm place the firm in the middle of an interdependent network &ndash; a confederation 
of mutually complementary competencies and capabilities &ndash; which competes as an integrated supply chain against other 
supply chains. To manage in such a radically revised competitive structure clearly requires different skills and competencies 
than those used in the traditional structure. To achieve future global market leadership in the networked competitive 
environment necessitates a network focused management model and the associated management processes.
</p>
<p>One of the key cognitive characteristics of any network is its configurative structure, which specifies how a supply chain 
is constructed in terms of its flow model. Such network structure dimension determines how big the supply base is; how 
wide the extent of vertical integration is; how much its level of outsourcing is; where the suppliers are located; how close 
the dyadic relationships are; what the channels of connection for the network are; and etc.. As it happens, globalisation has, 
amongst many other forces, propelled some unprecedented shifts in network structure and configuration. Evidences from 
numerous surveys and case studies show that more and more leading edge enterprises are outsourcing more strategically 
important functions and vertically disintegrating the supply chain to geographically, economically and culturally remote 
destinations. 
</p>
<p>Such a momentum has inevitably given rise to some new challenges in reshaping the network management. Business 
strategies formulation must be carried out collectively with the network members. A significantly higher level of joint 
strategic development is required in order for the network to be truly effective. Another challenge is for the networks 
to break free from the often adversarial nature of buyer-supplier relationships. There is now a growing realisation that 
co-operation between network partners usually leads to improved performance generally. The result of the improved 
performance needs to be shared between the members of the network to achieve what&rsquo;s called &lsquo;win-win&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>Developing the shared information system for the network management is another challenge. Forecasting information, 
capacity information, and production information can all be collectively managed to reduce the inventory levels and 
achieve shorter lead-time and JIT delivery. Throughout the supply the material flows are gradually to be displaced by 
the information flow. Whilst the supply network becomes leaner in terms of less redundant materials in the process, 
the investment in the information systems and its management gets increasingly higher. Coordinating the IT system 
compatibility, software upgrading, maintenance and service could be resource hungry. However the gain in the much 
more coordinated operation and supply chain responsiveness is understood to be worth the cost.
</p>
<p>As supply network complexity and uncertainty becomes ever more persistent the challenges also ripple out to the supply 
chain risk management. This is particularly true when supply chains become more reliant on virtual networks. The 
emerging future model of risk management for supply chains cannot be a scheme of buying an insurance policy; nor 
would it be an experience of gambling. Companies that aspire for the supply chain leadership position in the future will 
be those who mitigate the risk by building various forms of reserves, including inventory, capacity, redundant suppliers, 
but in the meantime maintaining a competitive strength in business efficiency and responsiveness. 
</p>
<p>Managers thus must keep a vigilant eye on the trade-off between the risk and the cost of building a reserve to mitigate it. 
With so many related risks and risk-mitigation approaches to consider, it is suggested that managers must do two things 
when they begin to construct a supply network risk management strategy. First, they must create a shared organisation-
wide understanding of supply-chain risk. Then they must determine how to adapt general risk-mitigation approaches to 
the circumstances of their particular company.</p>

</p>
<p>The Future Challenges
</p>
<p>8.3 Watch the Dynamics 
</p>
<p>The third challenge is how to survive the dynamics of the never ending supply chain evolution. The future of supply chain 
will face unprecedented dynamics in terms of structural dynamics, technological dynamics, and relationship dynamics, 
to say the least.
</p>
<p>Structural dynamics
</p>
<p>From a system dynamics point of view, the flow structure of a supply chain is a typical dynamic system with lows and 
stock; there are feedbacks and delays. From managerial experience perspective, it is even more so; there are fluctuations 
of demand, overproduction, high inventory, capacity miss-match, backlogs of unfulfilled orders, delayed delivery and so 
on. The trouble is that the supply structure is growingly more complex, and market volatility is set to increase too. There 
is little doubt the dynamic behaviour of a supply chain is only to be exacerbated. A number of factors are at play, which 
is continuously contributing to the increased structural dynamics. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The first factor is that business around the world is becoming more specialised, and they become so rightly 
for their competitive advantages, utilisation of resources and returns on investment. This trend is leading to 
more inter-connections of the specialised operation in the supply chain networks. Specialisation gives rise 
to the need of coordination in between. Thus increase the complexity of the system and more triggers for 
dynamic changes. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The geographical expansion of supply chains around world also exacerbates the dynamic behaviour, as the 
delays in logistics and visibilities are worsened. It has also brought in the unstable factors such as different 
legal and financial systems, cultural and religious conflicts, indigenous market related ethical issues.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The rapid growing environmental concerns around world have already started to reshape the supply chains. 
Not only the resourcing strategies, but also the production and logistics processes have felt the significant 
impact. Carbon footprint has become the KPI for many supply chains across industries, which they never 
heard of in just few years back. Consequently, the structure of the supply chains will have to change.
</p>
<p>Technological dynamics
</p>
<p>Innovation and technology advancement have been great news for the business and the consumers alike in most cases. But 
the changeover to new technologies can be a very painful process as it induces series of dynamic changes to the supply 
chains. All too often the disruptive technology advancement decease the existing operating model and invalidates the 
existing markets. The changing dynamics that have been enforced upon the supply chain can be observed from number 
of directions:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Sudden change of competition landscape when the new technology advancement has helped the competitors 
to update their offering to the market. </p>

</p>
<p>110 
</p>
<p>The Future Challenges
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The manufacture may be forced to switch the suppliers due to the desperate need of the new technology in 
the supply base in order to keep competitive.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Sudden arise of the new investment requirement due to the pressure to upgrade the equipments and 
facilities to cater the new technology.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Unfolding a significant skill gap in the workforce due to the unpreparedness of the technology.
</p>
<p>Relationship dynamics 
</p>
<p>Many people believe the operating core of supply chain management is that of relationships with the suppliers and buyers 
including the end consumers. Hence, the external business relationship management for a company has become the centre 
piece of today&rsquo;s and arguably the future&rsquo;s supply chain management. However the conceptual alignment of this concept 
in the academic as well as the practitioners&rsquo; circles has always been a quagmire, as there are many apparently conflicting 
approaches towards managing the relationships.

<p>111 
</p>
<p>The Future Challenges
</p>
<p>It is now emerging, that no single existing relationship model so far can possibly serve all business needs because of 
the underlying dynamism. There are basically two key dynamisms in the relationship management, one is the portfolio 
dynamism and the other is longitudinal dynamism. The portfolio dynamism addresses a portfolio different relationship 
approaches that fit to a corresponding portfolio of business models. Thus, in often times, business will need to harness with 
a number of different supply chain relationships to different suppliers based on product categories, market segmentations, 
development strategies, and financial circumstances and so on. The longitudinal dynamism addresses the changing 
relationship posture along the time continuum. In this way the relationship management becomes a powerful instrument 
to achieve the supply chain responsiveness and supply chain agility. It is anticipated that the future supply relationship 
management will hinge on a combined approach that addresses both the portfolio and longitudinal dynamisms.
</p>
<p>How to survive the supply chain dynamics? 
</p>
<p>The Triple-A supply chain model proposed by Professor Hau Lee (2007) from Stanford University is a useful blueprint 
to survive the supply chain dynamics. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The triple-A stands for Agility, Adaptability and Alignment. A supply chain must be agile enough in order 
to respond quickly to the dynamics of demand fluctuations and sudden changes of supply. The agility is a 
supply chain capability that handles the unexpected external disruptions smoothly and cost effectively. It 
enables the supply chain to survive the impact of the external dynamics and be able to recover from any 
initial shocks.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Adaptability differs from the agility in that it deals with more long-term and fundamental changes in the 
overall external environment, which is often irreversible. Adaptability calls for organisation and its supply 
chain to embark on major strategic changes in technology, market positioning, radical skill upgrading and 
competence shift. It helps the supply chain to survive the long waves of external dynamics. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Alignment is a supply chain capability that coordinates and balances the interests of all members. It 
addresses the supply chain&rsquo;s internal dynamics and ensures the supply chain to remain as a stable and 
cohesive whole. It also means to align all the complimentary resources and optimise the operational 
effectiveness and relationship to deliver the competitive advantage. </p>
