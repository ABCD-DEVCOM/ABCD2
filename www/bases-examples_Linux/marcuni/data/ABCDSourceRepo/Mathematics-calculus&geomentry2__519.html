<p>Preface to First Edition
</p>
<p>The importance assigned to accuracy in basic mathematics courses has, initially,
</p>
<p>a useful disciplinary purpose but can, unintentionally, hinder progress if it fosters
</p>
<p>the belief that exactness is all that makes mathematics what it is. Multivariate
</p>
<p>calculus occupies a pivotal position in undergraduate mathematics programmes in
</p>
<p>providing students with the opportunity to outgrow this narrow viewpoint and to
</p>
<p>develop a flexible, intuitive and independent vision of mathematics. This possi-
</p>
<p>bility arises from the extensive nature of the subject.
</p>
<p>Multivariate calculus links together in a non-trivial way, perhaps for the first
</p>
<p>time in a student&rsquo;s experience, four important subject areas: analysis, linear
</p>
<p>algebra, geometry and differential calculus. Important features of the subject are
</p>
<p>reflected in the variety of alternative titles we could have chosen, e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;Advanced
</p>
<p>Calculus&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;Vector Calculus&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;Multivariate Calculus&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;Vector Geometry&rsquo;&rsquo;,
</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Curves and Surfaces&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;Introduction to Differential Geometry&rsquo;&rsquo;. Each of
</p>
<p>these titles partially reflects our interest but it is more illuminating to say that here
</p>
<p>we study differentiable functions, i.e.
</p>
<p>functions which enjoy a good local approximation by linear functions.
</p>
<p>The main emphasis of our presentation is on understanding the underlying
</p>
<p>fundamental principles. These are discussed at length, carefully examined in
</p>
<p>simple familiar situations and tested in technically demanding examples. This
</p>
<p>leads to a structured and systematic approach of manageable proportions which
</p>
<p>gives shape and coherence to the subject and results in a comprehensive and
</p>
<p>unified exposition.
</p>
<p>We now discuss the four underlying topics and the background we expect&mdash;
</p>
<p>bearing in mind that the subject can be approached with different levels of
</p>
<p>mathematical maturity. Results from analysis are required to justify much of this
</p>
<p>book, yet many students have little or no background in analysis when they
</p>
<p>approach multivariate calculus. This is not surprising as differential calculus
</p>
<p>preceded and indeed motivated the development of analysis. We do not list
</p>
<p>analysis as a prerequisite, but hope that our presentation shows its importance and
</p>
<p>motivates the reader to study it further.
</p>
<p>Since linear approximations appear in the definition of differentiable functions,
</p>
<p>it is not surprising that linear algebra plays a part in this book. Several-variable
</p>
<p>vii</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>calculus and linear algebra developed, to a certain extent, side by side to their
</p>
<p>mutual benefit. The primary role of linear algebra, in our study, is to provide a
</p>
<p>suitable notation and framework in which we can clearly and compactly introduce
</p>
<p>concepts and present and prove results. This is more important than it appears
</p>
<p>since to quote T. C. Chaundy, &lsquo;&lsquo;notation biases analysis as language biases
</p>
<p>thought&rsquo;&rsquo;. An elementary knowledge of matrices and determinants is assumed and
</p>
<p>particular results from linear algebra are introduced as required.
</p>
<p>We discuss the role of geometry in multivariate calculus throughout the text and
</p>
<p>confine ourselves here to a brief comment. The natural setting for functions which
</p>
<p>enjoy a good local approximation by linear functions are sets which enjoy a good
</p>
<p>local approximation to linear spaces. In one and two dimensions this leads to
</p>
<p>curves and surfaces, respectively, and in higher dimensions to differentiable
</p>
<p>manifolds.
</p>
<p>We assume the reader has acquired a reasonable knowledge of one-variable
</p>
<p>differential and integral calculus before approaching this book. Although not
</p>
<p>assumed, some experience with partial derivatives allows the reader to proceed
</p>
<p>rapidly through routine calculations and to concentrate on important concepts.
</p>
<p>A reader with no such experience should definitely read Chapter 1 a few times
</p>
<p>before proceeding and may even wish to consult the author&rsquo;s Functions of Two
</p>
<p>Variables (Chapman and Hall 1995).
</p>
<p>We now turn to the contents of this book. Our general approach is holistic and
</p>
<p>we hope that the reader will be equally interested in all parts of this book.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is possible to group certain chapters thematically.
</p>
<p>Differential Calculus on Open Sets and Surfaces (Chapters 1&ndash;4).
</p>
<p>We discuss extremal values of real-valued functions on surfaces and open sets.
</p>
<p>The important principle here is the Implicit Function Theorem, which links linear
</p>
<p>approximations with systems of linear equations and sets up a relationship between
</p>
<p>graphs and surfaces.
</p>
<p>Integration Theory (Chapters 6, 9, 11&ndash;15).
</p>
<p>The key concepts are parameterizations (Chapters 5, 10 and 14) and oriented
</p>
<p>surfaces (Chapter 12). We build up our understanding and technical skill step by
</p>
<p>step, by discussing in turn line integrals (Chapter 6), integration over open subsets
</p>
<p>of R2 (Chapter 9), integration over simple surfaces without orientation (Chapter
</p>
<p>11), integration over simple oriented surfaces (Chapter 12) and triple integrals over
</p>
<p>open subsets of R3(Chapter 14). At appropriate times we discuss generalizations of
</p>
<p>the fundamental theorem of calculus, i.e. Green&rsquo;s Theorem (Chapter 9), Stokes&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Theorem (Chapter 13) and the Divergence Theorem (Chapter 15). Special attention
</p>
<p>is given to the parameterization of classical surfaces, the evaluation of surface
</p>
<p>integrals using projections, the change of variables formula and to the detailed
</p>
<p>examination of involved geometric examples.

<p>Geometry of Curves and Surfaces (Chapters 5, 7&ndash;8, 10, 16&ndash;18).
</p>
<p>We discuss signed curvature in R2 and use vector-valued differentiation to
</p>
<p>obtain the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations for curves in R3. The abstract geometric study
</p>
<p>of surfaces using Gaussian curvature is, regrettably, usually not covered in
</p>
<p>multivariate calculus courses. The fundamental concepts, parameterizations and
</p>
<p>plane curvature, are already in place (Chapters 5, 7 and 10) and examples from
</p>
<p>integration theory (Chapters 11&ndash;15) provide a concrete background and the
</p>
<p>required geometric insight. Using only curves in R2 and critical points of functions
</p>
<p>of two variables we develop the concept of Gaussian curvature. In addition, we
</p>
<p>discuss normal, geodesic and intrinsic curvature and establish a relationship
</p>
<p>between all three. In the final chapter we survey informally a number of interesting
</p>
<p>results from differential geometry.
</p>
<p>This text is based on a course given by the author at University College, Dublin.
</p>
<p>The additions that emerged in providing details and arranging self-sufficiency
</p>
<p>suggest that it is suitable for a course of 30 lectures. Although the different topics
</p>
<p>come together to form a unified subject, with different chapters mutually
</p>
<p>supporting one another, we have structured this book so that each chapter is self-
</p>
<p>contained and devoted to a single theme.
</p>
<p>This book can be used as a main text, as a supplementary text or for self-study.
</p>
<p>The groupings summarised above allow a selection of short courses at a slower
</p>
<p>pace. The exercises are extremely important as it is through them that a student can
</p>
<p>assess progress and understanding.
</p>
<p>Our aim was to write a short book focusing on basic principles while acquiring
</p>
<p>technical skills. This precluded comments on the important applications of mul-
</p>
<p>tivariate calculus which arise in physics, statistics, engineering, economics and,
</p>
<p>indeed, in most subjects with scientific aspirations.
</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to acknowledge the help I received in bringing this project to
</p>
<p>fruition. Dana Nicolau displayed skill in preparing the text and great patience in
</p>
<p>accepting with a cheerful &lsquo;&lsquo;OK, OK,&rsquo;&rsquo; the continuous stream of revisions, cor-
</p>
<p>rections and changes that flowed her way. Michael Mackey&rsquo;s diagrams speak for
</p>
<p>themselves. Brendan Quigley&rsquo;s geometric insight and Pauline Mellon&rsquo;s sugges-
</p>
<p>tions helped shape our outlook and the text. I would like to thank the Third Arts
</p>
<p>students at University College, Dublin, and especially Tim Cronin and Martin
</p>
<p>Brundin for their comments, reactions and corrections. Susan Hezlet of Springer
</p>
<p>provided instantaneous support, ample encouragement and helpful suggestions at
</p>
<p>all times. To all these and the community of mathematicians whose results and
</p>
<p>writings have influenced me, I say&mdash;thank you!

<p>Preface to Third Edition
</p>
<p>Fifteen years have elapsed since the first edition was published and 5 years have
</p>
<p>gone by since I last taught a course on the topics in this book. It is nice to know that
</p>
<p>Springer still believes that new generations of teachers and students may still be
</p>
<p>interested in my approach and I am grateful to them for allowing me the opportunity
</p>
<p>to correct some errors, to revise some material, and to pass on to new readers
</p>
<p>comments of previous readers. I have, I hope, maintained the style, format, general
</p>
<p>approach and the results of previous editions. I have made changes in practically all
</p>
<p>chapters but the main changes occur in the final three chapters, which is an intro-
</p>
<p>duction to the differential geometry of surfaces in three-dimensional space. And now
</p>
<p>some important information which was not sufficiently stressed in earlier prefaces:
</p>
<p>as preparation to using this book readers should have completed a course in linear
</p>
<p>algebra and a first course on partial differentiation. Chapter 1 in this book is a
</p>
<p>summary of material that is presumed known and an introduction to notation that we
</p>
<p>use throughout the book.
</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to thank Michael Mackey for his continued support and practical
</p>
<p>and mathematical help in preparing this edition. Joerg Sixt and Catherine
</p>
<p>Waite from Springer have been supportive and efficient throughout the period of
</p>
<p>preparation of this edition.

<p>Chapter 1
</p>
<p>Introduction to Differentiable Functions
</p>
<p>Summary We introduce differentiable functions, directional and partial derivatives,
</p>
<p>graphs and level sets of functions of several variables.
</p>
<p>In this concise chapter we introduce continuous and differentiable functions between
</p>
<p>arbitrary finite dimensional spaces. We pay particular attention to notation, as appro-
</p>
<p>priate notation is often the difference between simple and complicated presentations
</p>
<p>of several-variable calculus. Once this is in place many of our calculations follow
</p>
<p>the same lines as in the one dimensional calculus. We do not include proofs but, for
</p>
<p>readers familiar with analysis, we provide suggestions that lead to proofs along the
</p>
<p>lines that apply in the one variable calculus.
</p>
<p>The following extremely simple example illustrates the type of calculation we
</p>
<p>will be executing frequently and the reader should practice similar examples until
</p>
<p>they become routine and the intermediate step is unnecessary.
</p>
<p>Example 1.1 Let
</p>
<p>f : R3 &minus;&rarr; R, f (x, y, z) = xey + y2z3.
</p>
<p>The partial derivative of f with respect to x ,
&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;x
or fx , is obtained by treating y
</p>
<p>and z as constants and differentiating with respect x in the usual one variable way.
</p>
<p>Thus if A = ey and B = y2z3 then f (x, y, z) = Ax + B and
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;x
=
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dx
(Ax + B) = A = ey .
</p>
<p>Similarly if C = x and D = z3 then f (x, y, z) = Cey + Dy2 and
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;y
=
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dy
(Cey + Dy2) = Cey + 2Dy = xey + 2yz3,
</p>
<p>and, if E = xey and F = y2, then f (x, y, z) = E + Fz3 and

</p>
<p>We now recall concepts and notation from linear algebra. First we define the dis-
</p>
<p>tance between vectors in Rn . This will enable us to define convergent sequences, open
</p>
<p>and closed sets, continuous and differentiable functions, and state the fundamental
</p>
<p>existence theorem for maxima and minima.
</p>
<p>If X = (x1, . . . , xn) &isin; Rn let ‖X‖ = (x21 + &middot; &middot; &middot; + x
2
n )
</p>
<p>1/2 and call ‖X‖ the length
(or norm) of X . If X and Y = (y1, . . . , yn) are vectors in Rn then ‖X &minus; Y‖ is the
distance between X and Y . The inner product (or dot product or scalar product) of
</p>
<p>X and Y , X &middot; Y or 〈X,Y 〉, is defined as
</p>
<p>〈X,Y 〉 = X &middot; Y =
n
&sum;
</p>
<p>i=1
xi yi .
</p>
<p>We have ‖X‖2 = 〈X, X〉 and two vectors X and Y are perpendicular if and only
if their inner product is zero.
</p>
<p>For 1 &le; j &le; n, let e j = (0, . . . , 1, 0, . . .), where 1 lies in the j th position. The
set (e j )
</p>
<p>n
j=1 is a basis, the standard unit vector basis,
</p>
<p>1 for Rn . If X = (x1, . . . , xn) &isin;
R
n then
</p>
<p>X = x1e1 + x2e2 + &middot; &middot; &middot; + xnen =
n
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>i=1
xiei =

&sum;

<p>j=1
〈X, e j 〉e j .
</p>
<p>A mapping T : Rn &minus;&rarr; Rm is linear if
</p>
<p>T (aX + bY ) = aT (X)+ bT (Y )
</p>
<p>for all X,Y &isin; Rn and all a, b &isin; R. For 1 &le; i &le; m and 1 &le; j &le; n let
ai, j = 〈T (e j ), ei 〉. If X = (x1, . . . , xn) then, interchanging the order of summa-
tion, we obtain
</p>
<p>T (X) = T

</p>
<p>the space involved. Otherwise we would be using more and more unwieldy notation.</p>

</p>
<p>This shows that T (X) = A(X) where the m &times; n matrix A = (ai, j )1&le;i&le;m,1&le; j&le;n
operates on the column vector X by matrix multiplication. We may now identify
</p>
<p>the space of linear mappings from Rn into Rm with the space of m &times; n matrices,
Mm,n . To present in a reasonable form the product rule and chain rule (see below)
</p>
<p>we identify Rn with Mn,1, that is the points in R
n are considered to be column
</p>
<p>vectors. The reader should however note that, for typographical convenience, this
</p>
<p>convention is often ignored and points in Rn are written as row vectors. However, in
</p>
<p>taking derivatives the correct convention should be followed to avoid meaningless
</p>
<p>expressions.
</p>
<p>A subset U of Rn is open if for each X0 &isin; U there exists ε &gt; 0 such that2
</p>
<p>{X &isin; Rn : ‖X &minus; X0‖ &lt; ε} &sub; U.
</p>
<p>A subset A of Rn is closed if its complement is open and a set B is bounded if
</p>
<p>there exists M &isin; R such that ‖x‖ &le; M for all x &isin; B. Thus all points in an open set
A are surrounded by points from A while any point that can be reached from a closed
</p>
<p>set B belongs to B. A crucial role in all aspects of calculus, analysis and geometry is
</p>
<p>played by sets which are both closed and bounded; such sets are said to be compact.
</p>
<p>Example 1.2 The closed solid sphere {(x, y, z) : x2+ y2+ z2 &le; 1} and its boundary
{(x, y, z) : x2 + y2 + z2 = 1} are both compact subsets of R3 while the solid sphere
without boundary {(x, y, z) : x2 + y2 + z2 &lt; 1} is an open bounded subset of R3.
A line is a closed unbounded set while every open subset of R3 is a union of open
</p>
<p>spheres.
</p>
<p>If (Xk)
&infin;
k=1 is a sequence of vectors in R
</p>
<p>n and Y &isin; Rn then we say that Xk
converges to Y as k tends to infinity and write Xk &minus;&rarr; Y as k &minus;&rarr; &infin; and
limk&rarr;&infin; Xk = Y if
</p>
<p>‖Xk &minus; Y‖ &minus;&rarr; 0 as k &minus;&rarr; &infin;.
</p>
<p>Convergence in Rn is thus reduced to convergence in R. Moreover, if Xk =
(xk1 , . . . , x
</p>
<p>k
n ) and Y = (y1, . . . , yn) then
</p>
<p>lim
k&rarr;&infin;
</p>
<p>Xk = Y &lArr;&rArr; lim
k&rarr;&infin;
</p>
<p>xki = yi , 1 &le; i &le; n.
</p>
<p>A function F :U &sub; Rn &rarr; Rm is continuous at X0 &isin; U if for each sequence
(Xk)
</p>
<p>&infin;
k=1 in U
</p>
<p>2 The ε chosen will depend on X0 and to be rigorous we should indicate this dependence in some
</p>
<p>way, e.g. by writing εX0 . This would lead to unnecessarily complicated notation. We hope that this
</p>
<p>simplification will not be the source of any confusion.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>lim
k&rarr;&infin;
</p>
<p>Xk = X0 =&rArr; lim
k&rarr;&infin;
</p>
<p>F(Xk) = F(X0).
</p>
<p>When this is the case we write limX&rarr;X0 F(X) = F(X0). If F is continuous at
all points in U we say F is continuous on U .
</p>
<p>We could also define, in different ways, a length function on Mm,n , for instance
</p>
<p>by identifying Mm,n with R
mn . Any such standard definition will be equivalent to
</p>
<p>the following: if Ak &isin; Mm,n for all k, Ak = (aki, j )i, j and A = (ai, j )i, j then
</p>
<p>lim
k&rarr;&infin;
</p>
<p>Ak = A &lArr;&rArr; lim
k&rarr;&infin;
</p>
<p>aki, j = ai, j
</p>
<p>for all (i, j), 1 &le; i &le; m, 1 &le; j &le; n. We may now define for positive integers l,m
and n continuous mappings from U &sub; Rl &minus;&rarr; Mm,n .
</p>
<p>A function f :A &sub; Rn &rarr; R has a maximum on A if there exists X1 &isin; A such that
f (X) &le; f (X1) for all X &isin; A. We call f (X1) the maximum of f on A and say that
f achieves its maximum on A at X1. The maximum, if it exists, is unique but may be
</p>
<p>achieved at more than one point. A point X1 in A is called a local maximum of f on
</p>
<p>A if there exists δ &gt; 0 such that f achieves its maximum on A&cap;{X : ‖X&minus;X1‖ &lt; δ}
at X1. If, in addition, f (X) &lt; f (X1) whenever X &#13;= X1 we call X1 a strict local
maximum. Isolated local maxima are strict, i.e. if for some δ &gt; 0, X1 is the only
</p>
<p>local maximum of f in A&cap; {X : ‖X &minus; X1‖ &lt; δ} then X1 is a strict local maximum.
In particular, if the set of local maxima of f is finite then all local maxima are strict
</p>
<p>local maxima. The analogous definitions of minimum, local minimum and strict local
</p>
<p>minimum are obtained by reversing the above inequalities.
</p>
<p>Compact sets and continuity feature in the following fundamental existence the-
</p>
<p>orem for maxima and minima.
</p>
<p>Theorem 1.3 A continuous real-valued function defined on a compact subset of Rn
</p>
<p>has a maximum and a minimum.
</p>
<p>The practical problem of finding maxima and minima often requires a degree of
</p>
<p>smoothness finer than continuity called differentiability. Continuity and differentia-
</p>
<p>bility of most functions we encounter can be verified by using functions from R into
</p>
<p>R, addition, multiplication, composition of functions and linear mappings.
</p>
<p>Definition 1.4 Let F :U &sub; Rn &rarr; Rm , U open, and let X0 &isin; U . We say that F
is differentiable at X0 &isin; U if there exists a function A : U &minus;&rarr; Mm,n which is
continuous at X0 such that
</p>
<p>F(X) = F(X0)+ A(X)(X &minus; X0) (1.1)
</p>
<p>for all X &isin; U.
</p>
<p>If f :(a, b) &sub; R &minus;&rarr; R is differentiable at x0 &isin; (a, b) in the classical sense, that
is if
</p>
<p>f &prime;(x0) = lim
x&rarr;x0
</p>
<p>f (x)&minus; f (x0)
x &minus; x0</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Introduction to Differentiable Functions 5
</p>
<p>is finite, then letting
</p>
<p>A(x) =
{
</p>
<p>( f (x)&minus; f (x0))/(x &minus; x0), if x &#13;= x0,
f &prime;(x0), if x = x0,
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>we see that f is also differentiable in the sense of Definition 1.4. By using (1.1) we
</p>
<p>see that the converse is also true.
</p>
<p>The function A in Definition 1.4 is not necessary unique, However, if the matrix-
</p>
<p>valued functions A and B satisfy F(X) = F(X0) + A(X)(X &minus; X0) and F(X) =
F(X0)+ B(X)(X &minus; X0) and both are continuous at X0 then
</p>
<p>lim
X&rarr;X0
</p>
<p>A(X) = lim
X&rarr;X0
</p>
<p>B(X)
</p>
<p>and we call the common value the derivative of F at X0 and denote it by both DF(X0)
</p>
<p>and F &prime;(X0). If f is a scalar-valued function we also write &nabla; f (X) in place of f &prime;(X)
and call &nabla; f the gradient of f . Gradient is just another word for slope and, in one
variable calculus the derivative is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the
</p>
<p>function. Note that if F : Rn &rarr; Rm then F &prime;(X) is an m &times; n matrix (i.e. the order is
reversed) and is identified with a linear mapping from Rn into Rm . The term
</p>
<p>F(X0)+ F &prime;(X0)(X &minus; X0)
</p>
<p>is our linear approximation to F(X) near X0.
</p>
<p>If F is differentiable then F is continuous. The sum, difference and scalar
</p>
<p>multiple of differentiable functions are differentiable and the product of scalar-
</p>
<p>valued and vector-valued differentiable functions are differentiable. We have (see
</p>
<p>also Exercise 1.7) the following formulae whenever F,G : U &sub; Rn &minus;&rarr; Rm ,
f : U &sub; Rn &minus;&rarr; R are differentiable, a, b &isin; R, A &isin; Rm , T : Rn &minus;&rarr; Rm is linear
and (A + T )(X) = A + T (X) for all X &isin; Rm :
</p>
<p>(i) (aF + bG)&prime;(X) = aF &prime;(X)+ bG &prime;(X),
</p>
<p>(ii) ( f &middot; G)&prime;(X) = f (X) &middot; G &prime;(X)+ G(X) ◦ &nabla; f (X),
</p>
<p>(iii) (A + T )&prime;(X) = T .
</p>
<p>Part (ii) above is the product rule for differentiation. Note that &middot; denotes scalar mul-
tiplication, while ◦ denotes matrix multiplication of the m &times; 1 matrix G(X) and
the 1 &times; n matrix &nabla; f (X). Part (iii) tells us that the derivative of a linear function is
constant and equal to itself at all points while the derivative of a constant function is
</p>
<p>0 (in the appropriate space).
</p>
<p>The composition of differentiable functions is again differentiable and the chain
</p>
<p>rule, (1.2), gives the derivative of the composition in an elegant form. Let
</p>
<p>F : U (open) &sub; Rn &rarr; Rm, G : V (open) &sub; Rm &rarr; Rp</p>

<p>denote differentiable functions. If X &isin; U and F(X) &isin; V then (G ◦ F)&prime;(X) exists
and
</p>
<p>D(G ◦F)(X) = (G ◦F)&prime;(X) = G &prime;(F(X))◦F &prime;(X) = DG(F(X))◦DF(X). (1.2)
</p>
<p>If f : U &sub; Rn &minus;&rarr; R is differentiable at X = (x1, . . . , xn) &isin; U then &nabla; f (X) is a
1&times; n matrix, that is a row matrix with n entries. If ei &isin; Rn and gi (x) = X + xei for
all x &isin; R then gi is differentiable and g&prime;i (x) = [g
</p>
<p>&prime;
i (x)](e1) = ei at all x &isin; R. Since
</p>
<p>f ◦ gi (x) = f (X + xei ) = f (x1, . . . , xi&minus;1, xi + x, . . . , xn)
</p>
<p>the composition f ◦ gi : R &minus;&rarr; R is differentiable and

<p>This shows that

</p>
<p>If F :U &sub; Rn &minus;&rarr; Rm then F(X) has m coordinates f1(X), . . . , fm(X) and we
often write F = ( f1, . . . , fm) where each fi is a real-valued function of n variables.
Hence, F =

i=1 fiei and F is differentiable if and only if each fi is differentiable.

at any X &isin; Rn and, as above, G &prime;(x) = G &prime;(x)(e1) = v for all x &isin; R. If F :

the directional derivative of F at X in the direction v. Since

<p>If all first-order partial derivatives of F exist and are continuous then F is differ-
</p>
<p>entiable. This criterion enables us to see, literally at a glance, the sets on which most
</p>
<p>functions have derivatives, partial derivatives and directional derivatives. Consider,
</p>
<p>for instance, the function
</p>
<p>F(x, y, z) =
(
</p>
<p>sin(xyz), x2 &minus; y2, exp(xy)
)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>We have
</p>
<p>F(x, y, z) = sin(xyz)e1 + (x2 &minus; y2)e2 + exp(xy)e3
</p>
<p>and it suffices to consider separately the three R-valued functions sin(xyz), x2 &minus; y2
and exp(xy). Since linear functions are continuous and the composition and product
</p>
<p>of continuous functions are continuous we see, on calculating the partial derivatives,
</p>
<p>as in Example 1.1, that all the first order partial derivatives exist and are continuous.
</p>
<p>Hence F is differentiable.</p>

</p>
<p>Higher-order directional and partial derivatives are defined in the usual way, i.e.
</p>
<p>by repeated differentiation. If F : U &sub; Rn &minus;&rarr; Rm is differentiable then each row
in F &prime;(X) corresponds to a coordinate function of F while each column corresponds
to an (independent) coordinate variable.
</p>
<p>Example 1.5 Let F :R4 &rarr; R3 be defined by
</p>
<p>F(x, y, z,w) = (x2y, xyz, x2 + y2 + zw2).
</p>
<p>Then F = ( f1, f2, f3) where f1(x, y, z,w) = x2y, f2(x, y, z,w) = xyz and
f3(x, y, z,w) = x2 + y2 + zw2. Moreover, &nabla; f1(x, y, z,w) = (2xy, x2, 0, 0),
&nabla; f2(x, y, z,w) = (yz, xz, xy, 0) and &nabla; f3(x, y, z,w) = (2x, 2y,w2, 2zw). Hence
</p>
<p>F &prime;(x, y, z,w) =
</p>
<p>⎛
</p>
<p>⎝
</p>
<p>2xy x2 0 0
</p>
<p>yz xz xy 0
</p>
<p>2x 2y w2 2zw
</p>
<p>⎞
</p>
<p>⎠ .
</p>
<p>If X = (1, 2,&minus;1,&minus;2) and v = (0, 1, 2,&minus;2) then
</p>
<p>DvF(X) = F &prime;(X) ◦t v =
</p>
<p>⎛
</p>
<p>⎝
</p>

</p>
<p>Associated with any function F :U &sub; Rn &rarr; Rm we have two types of sets which
play a special role in the development of the subject&mdash;graphs and level sets. The
</p>
<p>graph of F is the subset of Rn+m defined as follows
</p>
<p>graph (F) =
{
</p>
<p>(X,Y ) : X &isin; U and Y = F(X)
}
</p>
<p>=
{
</p>
<p>(X, F(X)) : X &isin; U
}
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>If C = (c1, . . . , cm) is a point in Rm we define the level set of F , F&minus;1(C), by the
formula
</p>
<p>F&minus;1(C) =
{
</p>
<p>X &isin; U : F(X) = C
}
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>In terms of the coordinate functions f1, . . . , fm of F we have
</p>
<p>F(X) = C &lArr;&rArr; fi (X) = ci for i = 1, . . . ,m
</p>
<p>and hence
</p>
<p>F&minus;1(C) =
m
⋂
</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>{
</p>
<p>X &isin; U : fi (X) = ci

</p>
<p>Thus a level set of a vector-valued function is the finite intersection of level
</p>
<p>sets of real-valued functions. This is frequently useful in arriving at a geometrical
</p>
<p>interpretation of level sets as the following example shows.
</p>
<p>Example 1.6 Let F(x, y, z) = (x2 + y2 + z2 &minus; 1, 2x2 + 2y2 &minus; 1). We have F =
( f1, f2)where f1(x, y, z) = x2+y2+z2&minus;1 and f2(x, y, z) = 2x2+2y2&minus;1. The set
f &minus;11 (0) is a sphere of radius 1 while f
</p>
<p>&minus;1
2 (0) is a cylinder parallel to the z&ndash;axis built on
</p>
<p>a circle with centre the origin and radius 1/
&radic;
</p>
<p>2. If 0 = (0, 0) is the origin in R2 then
</p>
<p>F&minus;1(0) = f &minus;11 (0) &cap; f
&minus;1
2 (0)
</p>
<p>is the intersection of a sphere and a cylinder in R3 (Fig. 1.1a).
</p>
<p>For this particular example we obtain more information by solving the equations
</p>
<p>f1(x, y, z) = f2(x, y, z) = 0. We have x2 + y2 = 1 &minus; z2 = 1/2. Hence z2 = 1/2,
z = &plusmn;1/
</p>
<p>&radic;
2 and the level set consists of two circles on the unit sphere (Fig. 1.1b).
</p>
<p>The relationship between graphs and level sets plays an important role in our
</p>
<p>study. The easy part of this relationship&mdash;every graph is a level set&mdash;is given in the
</p>
<p>next example while the difficult part&mdash;every (regular) level set is locally a graph&mdash;is
</p>
<p>the implicit function theorem (Chap. 2).
</p>
<p>Example 1.7 Let F :U &sub; Rn &rarr; Rm . We define G:U &times; Rm &rarr; Rm by G(X,Y )
= F(X)&minus; Y . If 0 is the origin in Rm then
</p>
<p>(X,Y ) &isin; G&minus;1(0) &lArr;&rArr; G(X,Y ) = 0
&lArr;&rArr; F(X)&minus; Y = 0
&lArr;&rArr; (X,Y ) &isin; graph (F).
</p>
<p>Hence G&minus;1(0) = graph (F) and every graph is a level set.</p>

<p>Level Sets and Tangent Spaces
</p>
<p>Summary Using systems of linear equations as a guide we discuss the significance
</p>
<p>of the implicit function theorem for level sets. We define the tangent space and the
</p>
<p>normal space at a point on a level set.
</p>
<p>We shall be concerned with many different aspects of surfaces, level sets and graphs in
</p>
<p>this book. In this chapter we consider the role of differentiability in the local structure
</p>
<p>of level sets. By considering the linear approximation of differentiable functions and
</p>
<p>standard results on solving systems of linear equations we see that level sets are
</p>
<p>locally graphs.
</p>
<p>Let F : U &sub; Rn &rarr; Rm ,U open, F = ( f1, . . . , fm),C = (c1, . . . , cm) &isin; Rm . We
suppose that F is differentiable and consider the level set F&minus;1(C) =
</p>
<p>⋂m
i=1 f
</p>
<p>&minus;1
i (ci ),
</p>
<p>i.e. the points (x1, . . . , xn) &isin; U which satisfy the equations
</p>
<p>f1(x1, . . . , xn) = c1
... (2.1)
</p>
<p>fm(x1, . . . , xn) = cm .
</p>
<p>We haven unknowns, x1, . . . , xn andm equations. If each fi is linear we have a system
</p>
<p>of linear equations and the rank of the matrix of coefficients gives information on
</p>
<p>the number of linearly independent solutions and procedures on how to identify a
</p>
<p>complete set of independent variables. The implicit function theorem says that this
</p>
<p>process is also valid locally for differentiable functions. The key, of course, is the fact
</p>
<p>that differentiable functions, by definition, enjoy a good local linear approximation.
</p>
<p>Fix a point P &isin; F&minus;1(C) and suppose X &isin; Rn is close to 0 and P+ X &isin; F&minus;1(C).
Since F is differentiable,
</p>
<p>F(P + X) = F(P)+ F &prime;(P)(X)+ G(X)(X)
</p>
<p>where G : U &minus;&rarr; Mm,n and G(X) &rarr; 0 as X &rarr; 0. Since F(P + X) = F(X) = C ,
</p>
<p>F &prime;(P)(X) &asymp; 0

We assume from now on that n &ge; m. We thus have something very close to the
</p>
<p>following system of linear equations

</p>

</p>
<p>The matrix of coefficients of this system of linear equations is

<p>( &part; fi

<p>&part;x j
(P)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>1&le;i&le;m
1&le; j&le;n
</p>
<p>i.e. F &prime;(P). From linear algebra we have
</p>
<p>Rank
(
</p>
<p>F &prime;(P)
)
</p>
<p>= m &lArr;&rArr; the m rows of F &prime;(P) are linearly independent
&lArr;&rArr; there exist m linearly independent columns
</p>
<p>in F &prime;(P)
</p>
<p>&lArr;&rArr; F &prime;(P) contains m columns such that the
associated m &times; m matrix has non-zero
determinant
</p>
<p>&lArr;&rArr; the space of solutions for the system (2.2)
is n &minus; m dimensional.
</p>
<p>Moreover, if any of these conditions are satisfied and we choose m columns which
</p>
<p>are linearly independent then the variables corresponding to the remaining columns
</p>
<p>can be taken as a complete set of independent variables and the full set of solutions
</p>
<p>coincides with the graph of a function of the independent variables. If the above
</p>
<p>conditions are satisfied we say that F has full or maximum rank at P .
</p>
<p>As a simple example consider

<p>The 2 &times; 2 matrix obtained by using the first two columns is
(
</p>
<p>2 &minus;1
0 1
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>and this has
</p>
<p>determinant 2 �= 0. Hence A has rank 2 and the two rows are linearly independent.
Since the first two columns are linearly independent we can take the remaining two
</p>
<p>variables, z andw, as the independent variables. We have y = w, 2x = y&minus;z = w&minus;z
and so
</p>
<p>{(
</p>
<p>(w &minus; z)/2,w, z,w
)
</p>
<p>: z &isin; R, w &isin; R
}
</p>
<p>is the solution set for this system of
</p>
<p>equations. We can write this in the form
</p>
<p>{(
</p>
<p>φ(z,w), z,w
)
</p>
<p>: (z,w) &isin; R2
}
</p>
<p>where φ(z,w) =
(
</p>
<p>(w &minus; z)/2,w
)
</p>
<p>and in this format the solution space is the graph
</p>
<p>of the function φ (see Example 1.7).
</p>
<p>Note that columns 1 and 3 are not linearly independent, since the corresponding
</p>
<p>2 &times; 2 matrix
(
</p>
<p>2 1
</p>
<p>0 0
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>has zero determinant, and we cannot choose y and w (the
</p>
<p>remaining variables) as the independent variables.
</p>
<p>Assuming that the rows of F &prime;(P) are linearly independent is equivalent to requir-
ing that {&nabla; f1(P), . . . ,&nabla; fm(P)} are linearly independent vectors in Rn . The implicit
function theorem says that with this condition we can solve the non-linear system of
</p>
<p>Eq. (2.1) near P and use the same method to identify a set of independent variables.
</p>
<p>The hypothesis of a good linear approximation in the definition of differentiable
</p>
<p>functions implies that the systems of Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), are very close to one
</p>
<p>another.
</p>
<p>We now state without proof the Implicit Function Theorem.
</p>
<p>Theorem 2.1 (Implicit Function Theorem) Let F : U &sub; Rn &rarr; Rm , m &le; n, denote
a differentiable function, let P &isin; U and suppose F(P) = C and rank
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>F &prime;(P)
)
</p>
<p>= m
(for convenience we suppose that the final m columns of F &prime;(P) are linearly indepen-
dent). If P = (p1, . . . , pn) let P1 = (p1, . . . , pn&minus;m) and P2 = (pn&minus;m+1, . . . , pn)
so that P = (P1, P2). Then there exists an open set V in Rn&minus;m containing P1, a
differentiable function φ : V &rarr; Rm , an open subset W of U containing P such that
φ(P1) = P2 and
</p>
<p>F&minus;1(C) &cap;W =
{
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>X, φ(X)
)
</p>
<p>: X &isin; V
}
</p>
<p>= graph (φ).
</p>
<p>Thus locally every level set is a graph (Fig. 2.1).
</p>
<p>Example 2.2 Let F(x1, x2, x3, x4) = (x1x2, x3x24 ). We have
</p>
<p>F &prime;(x1, x2, x3, x4) =
(
</p>
<p>&nabla; f1(x1, x2, x3, x4)
&nabla; f2(x1, x2, x3, x4)

(
</p>
<p>x2 x1 0 0

</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>where f1(x1, x2, x3, x4) = x1x2 and f2(x1, x2, x3, x4) = x3x24 . Consider the level
set F&minus;1(2,&minus;4) and the point P = (1, 2,&minus;1, 2) &isin; F&minus;1(2,&minus;4). We have</p>

</p>
<p>If α(2, 1, 0, 0) + β(0, 0, 4,&minus;1) = (0, 0, 0, 0) then (2α, α, 4β,&minus;β) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
and hence α = β = 0. This implies that the rows of F &prime;(1, 2,&minus;1, 2) are linearly
independent and F &prime;(P) has rank 2. This can be seen even more rapidly by finding a
2&times;2 submatrix with non-zero determinant, e.g. if we use columns 2 and 3 we get the
</p>
<p>matrix
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1 0
</p>
<p>0 4
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>with determinant 4 �= 0. It is easily checked that the following pairs
</p>
<p>of columns are linearly independent (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3) and (2, 4) while the pairs
</p>
<p>(1, 2) and (3, 4) are not linearly independent. Since columns 1 and 4 are linearly
</p>
<p>independent we know that the variables x2 and x3 can be chosen as a complete set of
</p>
<p>independent variables. Thus we know that x1 and x4 can be expressed as functions
</p>
<p>of x2 and x3 near the point (1, 2,&minus;1, 2). The implicit function theorem is important
because it tells us that certain functions exist even though it does not show how
</p>
<p>to find them. In general, we would have to solve the system of Eq. (2.1) to find
</p>
<p>these functions and this may often be extremely difficult or even impossible in any
</p>
<p>reasonable fashion. In our rather simple situation we have the two equations
</p>
<p>x1x2 = 2
x3x
</p>
<p>2
4 = &minus;4
</p>
<p>and can find a solution. We have x1 = 2/x2 and since (x1, x2, x3, x4) is close to
(1, 2,&minus;1, 2) we have x2 close to 2 and the natural domain for x2 from this equation
is x2 &gt; 0. We have x
</p>
<p>2
4 = &minus;4/x3 and since x3 is close to &minus;1 we take x3 &lt; 0. Hence
</p>
<p>&minus;4/x3 is positive and x4 = &plusmn;
&radic;
&minus;4/x3. Since x4 is close to 2 we take the positive
</p>
<p>square root. Thus the function φ, whose existence is foretold by the Implicit Function
</p>
<p>Theorem, has the form

</p>
<p>An examination of the equations x1x2 = 2 and x3x24 = &minus;4 shows that it is not
possible to find, say x3, as a function of x1 and x2 and thus we cannot, as expected,
</p>
<p>use x1 and x2 as the independent variables.
</p>
<p>Example 2.3 Given the equations
</p>
<p>x2 &minus; y2 + u2 + 2v2 = 1 (2.3)
x2 + y2 &minus; u2 &minus; v2 = 2 (2.4)
</p>
<p>we wish to find all (x, y, u, v) such that near (x, y, u, v), u and v can be expressed
</p>
<p>as differentiable functions of x and y and we also wish to find
&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;x
and
</p>
<p>&part;v
</p>
<p>&part;x
in terms
</p>
<p>of x, y, u and v.
</p>
<p>Let F(x, y, u, v) = (x2 &minus; y2 + u2 + 2v2, x2 + y2 &minus; u2 &minus; v2). Then (x, y, u, v)
satisfies (2.3) and (2.4) if and only if F(x, y, u, v) = (1, 2), i.e. if and only if
(x, y, u, v) &isin; F&minus;1((1, 2)). We have
</p>
<p>F &prime;(x, y, u, v) =
(
</p>
<p>2x &minus;2y 2u 4v
2x 2y &minus;2u &minus;2v
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>We require x and y as a complete set of independent variables and so must have
</p>
<p>linear independence of the third and fourth columns. Hence we wish to find the
</p>
<p>points (x, y, u, v) such that det

</p>
<p>2u 4v
</p>
<p>&minus;2u &minus;2v

<p>= 4uv �= 0. This implies that any
</p>
<p>point (x, y, u, v) satisfying (2.3) and (2.4) with u and v both non-zero will be suitable.
</p>
<p>To compute
&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;x
and

<p>&part;v

we could apply the chain rule to the equation

<p>or just use (2.3) and (2.4) which now read
</p>
<p>x2 &minus; y2 + u(x, y)2 + 2v(x, y)2 = 1
x2 + y2 &minus; u(x, y)2 &minus; v(x, y)2 = 2.
</p>
<p>On differentiating we get

<p>&part;x
&minus; 2v(x, y)
</p>
<p>&part;v
</p>
<p>&part;x
= 0. (2.6)
</p>
<p>The method of differentiation used to obtain Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) is often called
</p>
<p>&ldquo;implicit differentiation&rdquo; especially in one-variable calculus where level sets of the
</p>
<p>form f (x, y) = 0 are considered.
These are just two linear equations in
</p>
<p>&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;x
and
</p>
<p>&part;v
</p>
<p>&part;x
which are easily solved to give

<p>&part;u

<p>&part;x

<p>u
and
</p>
<p>&part;v
</p>
<p>&part;x
=
</p>
<p>&minus;2x
v
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Notice how we need u and v to be both non-zero. In most cases of this type it is
</p>
<p>not possible to find explicit formulae for u and v by solving equations similar to
</p>
<p>(2.3) and (2.4)&mdash;hence the implicit in the implicit function theorem. So although in
</p>
<p>general we cannot find explicit formulae for the dependent variables in terms of the
</p>
<p>independent variables we can find the partial derivatives in terms of the independent
</p>
<p>and dependent variables. We choose this particular example because we are able to
</p>
<p>verify our formulae for
&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;x
and
</p>
<p>&part;v
</p>
<p>&part;x
. Adding (2.3) and (2.4) gives 2x2 + v2 = 3 and
</p>
<p>hence v = &plusmn;(3&minus;2x2)1/2 where we take the appropriate sign depending on the value
of v. We have
</p>
<p>&part;v
</p>
<p>&part;x
= &plusmn;

</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Subtracting (2.4) from (2.3) gives
</p>
<p>&minus;2y2 + 2u2 + 3v2 = &minus;1 = &minus;2y2 + 2u2 + 3(3 &minus; 2x2)
</p>
<p>i.e. 2u2 = 2y2 + 6x2 &minus; 10 and u = &plusmn;(3x2 + y2 &minus; 5)1/2. Hence

<p>denote a differentiable function which has full rank at the point P in U . Let F(P) =

<p>F&minus;1(C) = {X : F(X) = C} = {X : F(P + X &minus; P) = C}

<p>is the closest linear approximation to F&minus;1(C) near P and we call it the tangent space

<p>the set of all X satisfying the equation F &prime;(P)(X) = 0 is precisely the set of all
solutions {x1, . . . , xn} of the system of homogeneous linear equations (2.2) that we
encountered earlier and, as F has full rank at P , this space of solutions forms an

<p>the tangent space consists of the vectors which are perpendicular to the gradients of

<p>the component functions transferred to the point P (see Fig. 2.2). Normal vectors

<p>of vector subspaces of Rn to the point P . The tangent space is the subspace which

</p>
<p>In Rn there are various ways of presenting lines, planes, etc. The normal form
</p>
<p>consists of a description as the set of points satisfying a set of equations while the
</p>
<p>parametric form is in terms of independent variables and this, as we shall see in
</p>
<p>Chaps. 7 and 10, is almost a parametrization of the space.
</p>
<p>Example 2.4 Let S denote the set of all points in R3 which satisfy the equation
</p>
<p>x2 + 2y2 &minus; 5z2 = 1. We wish to find the tangent space and the normal line at the
point (2,&minus;1, 1) on S. Let f (x, y, z) = x2 + 2y2 &minus; 5z2. Then S = f &minus;1(1). The
tangent plane at P = (x0, y0, z0) in normal form is
</p>
<p>{
</p>
<p>(x, y, z) : &nabla; f (x0, y0, z0) &middot; (x &minus; x0, y &minus; y0, z &minus; z0) = 0
}
</p>
<p>=
{
</p>
<p>(x, y, z) : (x &minus; x0)
&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;x
(P)+ (y &minus; y0)
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;y
(P)+ (z &minus; z0)
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;z
(P) = 0
</p>
<p>}
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Now &nabla; f (x, y, z) = (2x, 4y,&minus;10z) and &nabla; f (2,&minus;1, 1) = (4,&minus;4,&minus;10) and so the
tangent plane at (2,&minus;1, 1) is
</p>
<p>{
</p>
<p>(x, y, z) : (x &minus; 2)4 + (y + 1)(&minus;4)+ (z &minus; 1)(&minus;10) = 0
}
</p>
<p>=
{
</p>
<p>(x, y, z) : 2x &minus; 2y &minus; 5z = 1
}
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>The normal line at (x0, y0, z0) is the line through (x0, y0, z0) in the direction of
</p>
<p>&nabla; f (x0, y0, z0). In our case we have, in parametric form, the normal line
{
</p>
<p>(2,&minus;1, 1)+ t (4,&minus;4,&minus;10) : t &isin; R
}
</p>
<p>=
{
</p>
<p>(2 + 4t,&minus;1 &minus; 4t, 1 &minus; 10t) : t &isin; R
}
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>To change this into normal form let x = 2 + 4t , y = &minus;1 &minus; 4t and z = 1 &minus; 10t .
Solving for t we get
</p>
<p>x &minus; 2
4

<p>=
y + 1
&minus;4
</p>
<p>=
z &minus; 1
&minus;10
</p>
<p>= t
</p>
<p>and obtain the normal form

<p>{
</p>
<p>(x, y, z) :
x &minus; 2

<p>To find the tangent plane in parametric form we must find two linearly independent

<p>vectors which are perpendicular to &nabla; f (x0, y0, z0). Applying the observation that
(x, y) and (&minus;y, x) are perpendicular vectors in R2 to different pairs of coordinates
in R3 we see easily that
</p>
<p>(4,&minus;4,&minus;10) &middot; (4, 4, 0) = 0

<p>and

<p>(4,&minus;4,&minus;10) &middot; (10, 0, 4) = 0

<p>Example 2.5 We wish to find the normal plane and the tangent line to the set of

</p>
<p>at the point (

</p>
<p>Let F(x, y, z) = (x2 + y2 &minus; 2z2, xyz). Then the set of points which satisfy the
above equations form the level set F&minus;1(2, 2). We have

<p>The final two columns form a 2 &times; 2 matrix with non-zero determinant and hence F
has full rank at (

</p>
<p>To find the normal plane in normal form we must find a non-zero vector perpendicular

<p>to both

</p>
<p>. The cross product (see Chaps. 6 and 7) of
</p>
<p>the two given vectors is of the required type but we take a first-principles approach
</p>
<p>here. This amounts to finding (a, b, c) such that
(&radic;

<p>&middot; (a, b, c) = 0 and

<p>Lagrange Multipliers
</p>
<p>Summary We develop the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum and
</p>
<p>minimum of a function with constraints.
</p>
<p>We consider the problem of finding the maximum and minimum of a sufficiently
</p>
<p>regular function g of n variables subject to the constraints
</p>
<p>f1(x1, . . . , xn) = c1
...
</p>

<p>(3.1)
</p>
<p>To apply differential calculus we suppose there exists an open subset U of Rn such
</p>
<p>that each fi is defined and differentiable on U and that all points which satisfy (3.1),
</p>
<p>that we wish to consider, lie in U . We also require g to be smooth in some fashion
</p>
<p>and it is convenient to suppose now that g is also differentiable on U .
</p>
<p>If F = ( f1, . . . , fm) then F :U &sub; Rn &rarr; Rm is differentiable and our problem
can be restated as that of finding the maximum and minimum of g on the level set
</p>
<p>F&minus;1(C) where C = (c1, . . . , cm). To apply the methods of the previous chapter we
suppose that F has full rank on F&minus;1(C) or equivalently that
</p>
<p>{
</p>
<p>&nabla; f1(X), . . . ,&nabla; fm(X)
}
</p>
<p>are linearly independent vectors for all X in F&minus;1(C).
Suppose g has a local maximum on F&minus;1(C) at the point P . Since we only need
</p>
<p>to examine g near P we may suppose that F&minus;1(C) is the graph of a function φ
of n &minus; m variables. By rearranging the variables, if necessary, we can assume that
φ : V &sub; Rn&minus;m &rarr; Rm , V open in Rn&minus;m , that P1 (the first n &minus; m coordinates of P)
lies in V and P = (P1, φ(P1)).
</p>
<p>Let X1 = (x1, . . . , xn&minus;m) &isin; Rn&minus;m . Since g has a local maximum on F&minus;1(C) at
P the function

of φ coincides with the level set F&minus;1(C) near P we have F(X1, φ(X1)) = C for all

<p>Let A denote the matrix in (3.4) evaluated at X1 = P1. Since the first n&minus;m rows of
A form a matrix with determinant 1 the matrix A has maximum rank n &minus;m. Hence
the space S = {X &isin; Rn : X ◦ A = 0}, i.e. the solution space for the system of n&minus;m
linear equations in n variables, is an n&minus; (n &minus;m) = m dimensional subspace of Rn .
Applying the chain rule to (3.3) and letting X1 = P1 we obtain
</p>
<p>&nabla; fi (P) ◦ A = 0
</p>
<p>for i = 1, . . . ,m. Hence each &nabla; fi (P) &isin; S. Since F &prime;(P) has maximum rank,
{&nabla; f1(P), . . . ,&nabla; fm(P)} is a set of m linearly independent vectors and hence a basis
for S. Since the function in (3.2) has a local maximum on the open set V at P1
one variable calculus shows that all its partial derivatives at P1 are zero. A further
</p>
<p>application of the chain rule implies
</p>
<p>&nabla;g(P) ◦ A = 0.
</p>
<p>Hence&nabla;g(P) &isin; S and there existm scalars, calledLagrangemultipliers,λ1, . . . , λm ,
such that
</p>
<p>&nabla;g(P) = λ1&nabla; f1(P)+ &middot; &middot; &middot; + λm&nabla; fm(P). (3.5)
</p>
<p>Equation (3.5), in coordinates, is a set of n equations, and these together with the
</p>
<p>system of m equations in (3.1) gives n + m equations in the n + m unknowns
{x1, . . . , xn, λ1, . . . , λm}. The method of Lagrange multipliers consists in solving
these equations. The solutions are the critical points of g on F&minus;1(C) and contain the</p>

<p>local maxima and minima of g. To determine if g has a maximum and minimum on
</p>
<p>F&minus;1(C) requires further on-the-spot investigation as we shall see in examples.
Frequently we are interested in finding the maximum and minimum on U &cap;
</p>
<p>F&minus;1(C) where U is open in Rn and U is the closure of U in Rn . The set U consists
of all points which can be reached from U , i.e.
</p>
<p>U = {X &isin; Rn; there exists (Xn)n &isin; U with ‖Xn &minus; X‖ &rarr; 0 as n &rarr; &infin;}.
</p>
<p>In this case we apply the method of Lagrange multipliers to U &cap; F&minus;1(C) and exam-
ine separately the values of g on (U\U ) &cap; F&minus;1(C)&mdash;these points are often easily
identified since they lie on the boundary of U .
</p>
<p>Example 3.1 To find the maximum and minimum of x + y + z subject to the con-
straints x2 + y2 = 2 and x + z = 1. Let F = ( f1, f2) where f1(x, y, z) = x2 + y2
and f2(x, y, z) = x+ z and let g(x, y, z) = x+ y+ z. We wish to find the maximum
and minimum of g on the set F&minus;1(2, 1). We have
</p>
<p>F &prime;(x, y, z) =
(
</p>
<p>2x 2y 0
</p>
<p>1 0 1
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>On F&minus;1(2, 1) we have x2 + y2 = 2 and so x and y cannot both be zero at the
same time. Thus the rows of F &prime;(x, y, z) are linearly independent when (x, y, z) &isin;
F&minus;1(2, 1). Hence &nabla; f1 and &nabla; f2 are linearly independent on F&minus;1(2, 1) and we may
apply the method of Lagrange multipliers. The level set
</p>
<p>F&minus;1(2, 1) =
{
</p>
<p>(x, y, z) : x2 + y2 = 2
}
</p>
<p>&cap;
{
</p>
<p>(x, y, z) : x + z = 1
}
</p>
<p>is the intersection of a cylinder parallel to the z-axis and a plane (why?) (see Fig. 3.1).
</p>
<p>This gives us a closed ellipse and compact set in R3. By the fundamental existence
</p>
<p>theorem g has a maximum and a minimum on F&minus;1(2, 1). This apparently rather
theoretical information has practical implications since we now know, before doing
</p>
<p>any calculations, that the method of Lagrange multipliers will yield at least two</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28 3 Lagrange Multipliers
</p>
<p>solutions and the maximum (minimum) solution will be the maximum (minimum)
</p>
<p>of g on F&minus;1(2, 1). By the method of Lagrange multipliers there exist, at local maxima
and minima, scalars λ1 and λ2 such that
</p>
<p>&nabla;g(x, y, z) = λ1&nabla; f1(x, y, z)+ λ2&nabla; f2(x, y, z)
</p>
<p>i.e.
</p>
<p>(1, 1, 1) = λ1(2x, 2y, 0)+ λ2(1, 0, 1).
</p>
<p>In terms of coordinates this is equivalent to the following system of equations
</p>
<p>1 = 2λ1x + λ2
1 = 2λ1y
1 = λ2
</p>
<p>⎫
</p>
<p>⎬
</p>
<p>⎭
</p>
<p>=&rArr; 1 = 2λ1x + 1 =&rArr; λ1x = 0.
</p>
<p>Hence λ1 = 0 or x = 0. However, the second equation implies 1 = 2λ1y so
λ1 �= 0. If x = 0 then f1(x, y, z) = y2 = 2 and y = &plusmn;
</p>
<p>&radic;
2, while f2(x, y, z) =
</p>
<p>x + z = 1 implies z = 1. Our only solutions are (0,
&radic;
</p>
<p>2, 1) and (0,&minus;
&radic;
</p>
<p>2, 1). Since
</p>
<p>g(0,
&radic;
</p>
<p>2, 1) =
&radic;
</p>
<p>2 + 1 and g(0,&minus;
&radic;
</p>
<p>2, 1) = &minus;
&radic;
</p>
<p>2 + 1 it follows that
&radic;
</p>
<p>2 + 1 and
&minus;
&radic;
</p>
<p>2 + 1 are the maximum and minimum of g on F&minus;1(2, 1).
Of course, substituting the constraint x + z = 1 into g = 0 implies g(x, y, z) =
</p>
<p>g(x, y, 1 &minus; x) = 1 + y and our problem reduces to finding the maximum and
minimum of 1+ y on the set x2 + y2 = 2. On this set &minus;
</p>
<p>&radic;
2 &le; y &le;
</p>
<p>&radic;
2 and hence the
</p>
<p>maximum is 1 +
&radic;
</p>
<p>2 and the minimum 1 &minus;
&radic;
</p>
<p>2. This verifies the solution obtained
</p>
<p>using Lagrange multipliers and also reminds us that it is always worthwhile thinking
</p>
<p>about a problem before attempting any solution.
</p>
<p>Example 3.2 The geometric mean of n positive numbers x1, . . . , xn , (x1 &middot; &middot; &middot; xn)1/n
</p>
<p>is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean
x1 + x2 + &middot; &middot; &middot; + xn
</p>
<p>n
.
</p>
<p>In this example (see also Example 3.4) we standardise one of the quantities and
</p>
<p>generate a Lagrange multiplier type problem. Let g(x1, . . . , xn) = x1 &middot; &middot; &middot; xn and
f (x1, . . . , xn) = x1 + x2 + &middot; &middot; &middot; + xn . We begin by finding the maximum of g on the
set
</p>
<p>f &minus;1(1) &cap;
{
</p>
<p>(x1, . . . , xn) : xi &ge; 0 for all i
}
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>It is easily checked that this is a compact set and, by the fundamental existence
</p>
<p>theorem, the maximum exists. On the set f &minus;1(1)&cap;
{
</p>
<p>(x1, . . . , xn) : xi &gt; 0
}
</p>
<p>we may
</p>
<p>apply the method of Lagrange multipliers. We have
</p>
<p>&nabla;g(x1, . . . , xn) = (x2 &middot; &middot; &middot; xn, x1x3 &middot; &middot; &middot; xn, . . . , x1x2 &middot; &middot; &middot; xn&minus;1)

<p>If &nabla;g(x1, . . . , xn) = λ&nabla; f (x1, . . . , xn) then x1 &middot; &middot; &middot; xn/xi = λ and xi = x1 &middot; &middot; &middot; xn/λ
for all i . This shows x1 = x2 = &middot; &middot; &middot; = xn . Since x1 + x2 + &middot; &middot; &middot; + xn = 1 we
have xi = 1/n for all i and g(1/n, 1/n, . . . , 1/n) = n&minus;n . As g(x1, . . . , xn) = 0

</p>
<p>Notice that although the number of variables, n, could be large symmetry led to rather

<p>simple equations. In mathematics symmetry compensates for size.
</p>
<p>Example 3.3 To find the dimensions of the box (Fig. 3.2) of maximum volume V
</p>
<p>given that the surface area S is 10 m2.
</p>
<p>We wish to maximise V (x, y, z) = xyz subject to the constraint S(x, y, z) =
2(xy+ yz+ xz) = 10. Physical constraints imply that x &ge; 0, y &ge; 0 and z &ge; 0. The
set U =
</p>
<p>{
</p>
<p>(x, y, z) : x &gt; 0, y &gt; 0, z &gt; 0
}
</p>
<p>is open and our problem is to determine
</p>
<p>the maximum of V on U &cap; S. The method of Lagrange multipliers will identify a set
which contains all local maxima and minima in U &cap; S. We proceed to do this now.
We have</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>30 3 Lagrange Multipliers
</p>
<p>&nabla;V (x, y, z) = (yz, xz, xy)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>&nabla;S(x, y, z) =
(
</p>
<p>2(y + z), 2(x + z), 2(x + y)
)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Since x, y and z are all positive on U we have &nabla;V (x, y, z) �= (0, 0, 0). Applying
the method of Lagrange multipliers we consider
</p>
<p>&nabla;V = λ&nabla;S
</p>
<p>and obtain the following system of equations
</p>
<p>yz = 2λ(y + z) =&rArr; xyz = 2λ(xy + xz)
xz = 2λ(x + z) =&rArr; xyz = 2λ(xy + yz)
xy = 2λ(x + y) =&rArr; xyz = 2λ(xz + yz).
</p>
<p>Hence λ �= 0 and, on dividing by 2λ, we get xy + xz = xy + yz = xz + yz and
afterwards xy = yz = zx . Since x �= 0, y �= 0 and z �= 0 this implies x = y = z
and S(x, y, z) = 10 now shows that 6x2 = 10. Hence x = y = z = (5/3)1/2. Let
P =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>(5/3)1/2, (5/3)1/2, (5/3)1/2
)
</p>
<p>. We have V (P) = (5/3)3/2.
</p>
<p>We now wish to show that V takes its maximum value, subject to the constraint
</p>
<p>S = 10, at P . The setU &cap; S&minus;1(10) is closed but not bounded and so the fundamental
existence theorem for maxima and minima cannot be applied directly. In such cases
</p>
<p>ad hoc methods are necessary and the following approach is sometimes useful. For
</p>
<p>r &gt; 0 let
</p>
<p>Ur =
{
</p>
<p>(x, y, z) : 0 &le; x &le; r, 0 &le; y &le; r, 0 &le; z &le; r
}
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>The set Ur is compact (i.e. closed and bounded) and as r increases to infinity Ur
expands, inside U , and in the limit, i.e. at infinity, it covers U . If V does have
</p>
<p>a maximum on U &cap; S&minus;1(10) then it must lie in some Ur . Since V (P) &gt; 1 our
strategy is to show that for r sufficiently large we have V (x, y, z) &le; 1 whenever
(x, y, z) /&isin; Ur . This will imply that the maximum of V on Ur , which exists by the
fundamental existence theorem, equals the maximum of V on U . If (x, y, z) /&isin; Ur
then one of x, y, z, say x , is greater than r . If S(x, y, z) = 10 then 2xy &le; 10 and
2xz &le; 10. Hence y &le; 10/2x = 5/x and z &le; 10/2x = 5/x &le; 5/r and
</p>
<p>V (x, y, z) = xyz &le; x &middot;
5
</p>
<p>x
&middot;
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>r
=
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>r
. (3.6)
</p>
<p>In particular, if r = 25 then V (x, y, z) &le; 1 for all (x, y, z) /&isin; U25 satisfying
S(x, y, z) = 10. Since P &isin; U25 and V (P) &gt; 1 this implies</p>

<p>V (x, y, z) : (x, y, z) &isin; U &cap; S&minus;1(10)
}

<p>= maximum
{
</p>
<p>V (x, y, z) : (x, y, z) &isin; U25 &cap; S&minus;1(10)
}
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Since U25 &cap; S&minus;1(10) is compact and V is continuous the fundamental existence the-
orem implies that V has a maximum on U25 &cap; S&minus;1(10). The maximum occurs either
inside or on the boundary. If it occurs inside then our use of Lagrange multipliers
</p>
<p>implies that it occurs at the point P . On the boundary of U25 we have either at least
</p>
<p>one coordinate zero, in which case V = 0, or at least one coordinate equal to 25 in
which case (3.6) implies V &le; 1 and we conclude that the maximum cannot occur
on the boundary. We have thus shown that the absolute maximum of V occurs at the
</p>
<p>point P =
(
</p>
<p>(5/3)1/2, (5/3)1/2, (5/3)1/2
)
</p>
<p>and equals (5/3)3/2.

<p>most widely used inequalities in mathematics. If we use vector notation, i.e. let
</p>
<p>a = (a1, . . . , an) and b = (b1, . . . , bn), and take square roots we can rewrite the
inequality as
</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣〈a,b〉
∣
</p>
<p>∣ &le; ‖a‖ &middot; ‖b‖. (3.7)
</p>
<p>The advantages of vector notation in this proof are obvious. Let g : R2n &rarr; R be
defined by g(a,b) = 〈a,b〉. Motivated by Example 3.2 and the form of the inequality
given in (3.7) we first find the maximum and minimum of g on the set ‖a‖2 =
‖b‖2 = 1.

</p>
<p>shows immediately that &nabla; f1(a,b) and &nabla; f2(a,b) are linearly independent whenever
a �= 0 and b �= 0 and implies that we may apply the method of Lagrange multipliers.
From &nabla;g = λ1&nabla; f1 + λ2&nabla; f2 and
</p>
<p>&nabla;g(a,b) = (b1, . . . , bn, a1, . . . , an) = (b, a)
</p>
<p>we see that
</p>
<p>(b, a) = λ1(2a, 0)+ λ2(0, 2b) = (2λ1a, 2λ2b).
</p>
<p>Hence b = 2λ1a and since ‖a‖ = ‖b‖ = 1 this implies 2λ1 = &plusmn;1 and b = &plusmn;a. If
b = a then g(a, a) =

<p>This is trivially verified if either a or b is 0. Since g(a,b) = 〈a,b〉, we have proved
the Cauchy&ndash;Schwarz inequality. The above also shows that we have equality in the

<p>Cauchy&ndash;Schwarz inequality if and only if a and b are parallel vectors. In particular,

<p>for unit vectors a and b, we have 〈a,b〉 = 1 if and only if a = b (see Example 8.5).

<p>Chapter 4
</p>
<p>Maxima and Minima on Open Sets
</p>
<p>Summary We derive, using critical points and the Hessian, a method of locating
</p>
<p>local maxima, local minima and saddle points of a real-valued function defined on
</p>
<p>an open subset of Rn .
</p>
<p>We turn to the problem of finding local maxima and local minima of a real-valued
</p>
<p>function f defined on an open subset U of Rn . The set of critical points of f on
</p>
<p>U , {X; &nabla; f (X) = 0}, will include all points where f achieves a local maximum or
minimum but may contain additional points such as saddle points. A critical point
</p>
<p>P is a saddle point if f , restricted to some curve passing through P , has a local
</p>
<p>maximum at P , while it has a local minimum at P along some other curve passing
</p>
<p>through P.
</p>
<p>The Hessian of f at P &isin; U , H f (P), is defined as the n &times; n matrix
(
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;xi&part;x j
(P)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>1&le;i, j&le;n
. To define the Hessian1 we are, of course, assuming that all
</p>
<p>first- and second-order partial derivatives of f exist. We use the convention that the
</p>
<p>order of differentiation is from right to left, i.e.
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;xi&part;x j
=
</p>
<p>&part;
</p>
<p>&part;xi
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;x j
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>If all these second-order partial derivatives exist and are continuous then the order
</p>
<p>of differentiation is immaterial and
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;xi&part;x j
(P) =
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;x j&part;xi
(P)
</p>
<p>for all i and j . In this case H f (P) is a symmetric n&times;n matrix. We will not prove this
result but provide, in Exercise 4.6, a practical method which proves that all functions
</p>
<p>you will probably ever encounter have this property. If v = (v1, . . . , vn) is a row
</p>

<p>The main theoretical result on the existence of local maxima, local minima and saddle
</p>
<p>points is the following theorem.
</p>
<p>Theorem 4.1 If U is an open subset of Rn , f : U &rarr; R is a twice continuously
differentiable function on U and P is a critical point of f , i.e.
</p>
<p>&nabla; f (P) =
(
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;x1
(P), . . . ,
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;xn
(P)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>= 0
</p>
<p>then
</p>
<p>(1) f has a strict local maximum at P if
&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;v2
(P) &lt; 0 for all v �= 0,
</p>
<p>(2) f has a strict local minimum at P if
&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;v2
&gt; 0 for all v �= 0,
</p>
<p>(3) f has a saddle point at P if there exist v and w such that
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;v2
(P) &lt; 0 &lt;
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;w2
(P).
</p>
<p>To derive a practical test from this result we use linear algebra and Lagrange mul-
</p>
<p>tipliers. To simplify matters we change our notation and let v = X = (x1, . . . , xn),
</p>
<p>ai j =
&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;xi&part;x j
(P) and A = (ai j )1&le;i, j&le;n . With this notation
</p>
<p>&part;2 f

<p>&part;v2
(P) = vH f (P)tv = X AtX.</p>

<p>X AtX &lt; 0 &lt; max

</p>
<p>X AtX.
</p>
<p>We thus need to examine the extreme values of X AtX on the set

<p>Let

<p>h(X) = h(x1, . . . , xn) =

<p>i, j=1

<p>g(X) = g(x1, . . . , xn) =

</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>i, j=1
x2i = 〈X, X〉.
</p>
<p>Since the set g&minus;1(1) is compact and h is continuous the fundamental existence the-
orem implies that h has a maximum and minimum on g&minus;1(1). Using the coordinate
expansion of g we see that &nabla;g(X) = (2x1, . . . , 2xn) = 2X and &nabla;g(X) �= 0 on
g&minus;1(1). Hence we may apply the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the maxi-
mum and the minimum of h on the set g&minus;1(1). We have
</p>
<p>&nabla;h(X) =
( n

<p>n

</p>
<p>j=1

</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>= 2X A.
</p>
<p>By the method of Lagrange multipliers there exists at the maximum and minimum
</p>
<p>points of h on g&minus;1(1) a real number λ such that
</p>
<p>2X A = 2λX.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Taking the transpose we get
</p>
<p>AtX = λtX = λI tX
</p>
<p>i.e.
</p>
<p>(A &minus; λI )tX = 0. (4.1)
</p>
<p>Since ‖X‖ = 1, any λ which satisfies (4.1) is an eigenvalue2 of A and, moreover,
</p>
<p>h(X) = X AtX = λX tX = λ〈X, X〉 = λ.
</p>
<p>Thus the maximum and minimum values of h are eigenvalues of A and are achieved
</p>
<p>at the corresponding unit eigenvectors. If all eigenvalues are positive then h is always
</p>
<p>positive and f has a local minimum at P , if all eigenvalues are negative then h is
</p>
<p>always negative and f has local maximum at P and if some are positive and some
</p>
<p>negative then h takes positive and negative values and f has a saddle point at P . If
</p>
<p>λ is an eigenvalue of A the set
</p>
<p>Eλ := {X &isin; Rn : AtX = λtX}
</p>
<p>is a subspace of Rn , called the λ-eigenspace of A, and the dimension of Eλ is called
</p>
<p>the multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ. An n &times; n symmetric matrix has n eigenvalues
when eigenvalues are counted according to multiplicity, i.e. if Eλ is j&ndash;dimensional
</p>
<p>then λ is counted j times, and det(A) = λ1 &middot; &middot; &middot; λn . Since a particular case of the above
result will play an important role in our study of Gaussian curvature in Chap. 16 we
</p>
<p>display it separately.
</p>
<p>Proposition 4.2 If A =
(
</p>
<p>ai j
)
</p>
<p>1&le;i, j&le;2 is a symmetric 2 &times; 2 matrix with eigenvalues
λ1 and λ2, λ1 &ge; λ2, then
</p>
<p>max.{a11x2 + 2a12xy + a22y2 : x2 + y2 = 1} = λ1
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>min.{a11x2 + 2a12xy + a22y2 : x2 + y2 = 1} = λ2.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the maximum and minimum are achieved at eigenvectors of A and
</p>
<p>det(A) = λ1λ2.
</p>
<p>For our test we just need to know the sign of the largest and smallest eigenvalues.
</p>
<p>Since eigenvalues may be difficult to calculate we will use a reasonably well-known
</p>
<p>result from linear algebra. If A is a square matrix then the k &times; k matrix Ak obtained
by deleting all except the first k rows and k columns of A is called the k&times;k principal
minor of A. We have An = A.
</p>
<p>2 We could refocus this analysis to show that any symmetric n &times; n matrix with real entries admits
eigenvalues.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4 Maxima and Minima on Open Sets 39
</p>
<p>We require the following result:
</p>
<p>if A is a symmetric n&times; n matrix then all eigenvalues of A are positive if and only
if det(Ak) &gt; 0 for all k.
</p>
<p>Proposition 4.3 If f : U &sub; Rn &rarr; R, U open, has continuous first- and second-
order partial derivatives, P is a critical point of f , and A = H f (P) is the Hessian
of f at P then the following hold:
</p>
<p>(a) if det(A2k) &lt; 0 for some k then P is a saddle point of f ,
</p>
<p>(b) if det(An) �= 0 then
</p>
<p>(b1) if det(Ak) &gt; 0 for all k then f has a strict local minimum at P,
</p>
<p>(b2) if (&minus;1)k det(Ak) &gt; 0 for all k then f has a strict local maximum at P,
(b3) if the conditions on the determinants in (b1) and (b2) do not apply then f
</p>
<p>has a saddle point at P.
</p>
<p>Proof (a) Suppose det(A2k) &lt; 0 for some positive integer k, 2k &le; n. If P =
(p1, . . . , pn) let Q = (p1, . . . , p2k). Consider the function g : V &sub; R2k &rarr; R
defined by
</p>
<p>g(x1, . . . , x2k) = f (x1, . . . , x2k, p2k+1, . . . , pn)
</p>
<p>where V is the open set in R2k consisting of all (x1, . . . , x2k) such that
</p>
<p>(x1, . . . , x2k, p2k+1, . . . , pn) &isin; U.
</p>
<p>It is easily checked that
</p>
<p>Hg(Q) =
(
</p>
<p>&part;2g
</p>
<p>&part;xi&part;x j
(Q)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>1&le;i, j&le;2k
=
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;xi&part;x j
(P)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>1&le;i, j&le;2k
= A2k .
</p>
<p>Let β1, . . . , β2k denote the 2k eigenvalues of the symmetric 2k &times; 2k matrix A2k
counted according to multiplicity. We have
</p>
<p>β1 &middot; &middot; &middot;β2k = det(A2k) &lt; 0.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40 4 Maxima and Minima on Open Sets
</p>
<p>Since 2k is an even integer it follows that A2k has positive and negative eigenvalues.
</p>
<p>Hence there exist u = (u1, . . . , u2k) and v = (v1, . . . , v2k) such that
</p>
<p>uA2k
tu &lt; 0 &lt; vA2k
</p>
<p>tv.
</p>
<p>Let w1 = (u1, . . . , u2k, 0, . . . , 0) and w2 = (v1, . . . , v2k, 0, . . . , 0). Then
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;w12
(P) = w1H f (P)tw1
</p>
<p>= uA2k tu &lt; 0 &lt; vA2k tv
</p>
<p>= w2H f (P)tw2 =
&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;w22
(P)
</p>
<p>and f has a saddle point at P . This proves (a).
</p>
<p>(b) The first part, (b1), follows directly from the linear algebra result quoted above.
</p>
<p>Since f has a local maximum at P if and only if (&minus; f ) has a local minimum at the
same point and H&minus; f (P) = &minus;H f (P) it follows, from (b1), that f has a local maximum
at P if det(&minus;Ak) &gt; 0 for all k. Hence (b2) follows since det(&minus;Ak) = (&minus;1)k det(Ak).
If (b1) and (b2) do not apply then, since all eigenvalues of A are non-zero, A has
</p>
<p>positive and negative eigenvalues and hence f has a saddle point at P . This completes
</p>
<p>the proof. �
</p>
<p>If det(H f (P)) = 0 we call P a degenerate critical point of f (all other critical
points are called non-degenerate) and higher order derivatives may be required to
</p>
<p>test the nature of the critical point.
</p>
<p>Proposition 4.3 enables us to classify all non-degenerate and some degenerate
</p>
<p>critical points. When P is a non-degenerate critical point of f and f has a local
</p>
<p>maximum or minimum at P then the determinants of the odd principal minors all
</p>
<p>have the same sign. This leads to the second test for saddle points given below and
</p>
<p>a little reflection shows that it may be applied at any critical point. In practice the
</p>
<p>determinants, det(Ai ), are calculated in the order i = 1, 2, 3, . . . and testing for
saddle points is carried out as the calculations proceed. The critical point is a saddle
</p>
<p>point and the calculations stop when for the first time either of the following is
</p>
<p>observed:
</p>
<p>det(A2k) &lt; 0
</p>
<p>det(A2k&minus;1) det(A2k+1) &lt; 0.
</p>
<p>If (b1) or (b2) are used to find a local maximum or minimum then all determinants
</p>
<p>of the Hessian must be calculated.</p>

</p>
<p>Example 4.4 Let f (x, y, z) = x2y2 + z2 + 2x &minus; 4y + z. We have
</p>
<p>&nabla; f (x, y, z) = (2xy2 + 2, 2x2y &minus; 4, 2z + 1).
</p>
<p>If P is a critical point of f then
</p>
<p>2xy2 + 2 = 0
2x2y &minus; 4 = 0
</p>
<p>2z + 1 = 0
</p>
<p>Hence z = &minus;1/2 from the third equation. From the first two equations we see that x
and y are non-zero. Hence xy2 = &minus;1 and x2y = 2 imply xy2/x2y = &minus;1/2 = y/x
and x = &minus;2y. We have&minus;2y &middot; y2 = &minus;1, i.e. y3 = 1/2 and y = 2&minus;1/3. From x = &minus;2y
we obtain x = &minus;22/3 and conclude that (&minus;22/3, 2&minus;1/3,&minus;1/2) is the only critical
point of f . A simple calculation shows that
</p>
<p>H f (x,y,z) =
</p>

<p>0 0 2

<p>and hence

<p>H f (&minus;22/3,2&minus;1/3,1/2) =

</p>

</p>
<p>Since det(21/3) &gt; 0 and

<p>(
</p>
<p>21/3 &minus;4 &middot; 21/3

<p>= 2 &middot; 25/3 &minus; 16 &middot; 22/3
</p>
<p>= 4 &middot; 22/3 &minus; 16 &middot; 22/3 &lt; 0
</p>
<p>the critical point (&minus;22/3, 2&minus;1/3,&minus;1/2) is a saddle point of f .
</p>
<p>Example 4.5 We wish to find and classify the non-degenerate critical points of
</p>
<p>f (x, y, z) = x2y + y2z + z2 &minus; 2x . We have
</p>
<p>&nabla; f (x, y, z) = (2xy &minus; 2, x2 + 2yz, y2 + 2z)
</p>
<p>and the critical points satisfy the equations
</p>
<p>2xy &minus; 2 = 0, x2 + 2yz = 0 and y2 + 2z = 0.
</p>
<p>Substituting z = &minus;y2/2 into the second equation implies y3 = x2. Hence, the first
equation shows y5/2 = 1 and we have y = 1 and z = &minus;1/2. From xy = &minus;1 we get</p>

</p>
<p>Since det(2) &gt; 0 and

</p>
<p>2 &minus;1
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>= &minus;2 &minus; 4 &lt; 0
</p>
<p>the point (1, 1,&minus;1/2) is a saddle point of f .
</p>
<p>A number of simple initial checks may be carried out to detect saddle points. These
</p>
<p>are based on rearranging the variables, a procedure which does not alter the nature
</p>
<p>of a critical point. Thus we may first interchange row i and row j and afterwards
</p>
<p>column i and column j in the Hessian and then apply our standard test. In this way
</p>
<p>any 2 &times; 2 sub-matrix of the Hessian, which is symmetric about the diagonal, can
be moved to become the 2 &times; 2 principal minor. Since a 2 &times; 2 symmetric matrix
with positive and negative diagonal entries has negative determinant this means that
</p>
<p>a critical point is a saddle point if the diagonal contains positive and negative terms.
</p>
<p>This applies, for instance, to Example 4.5. Another useful indicator is the presence
</p>
<p>of a relatively large non-diagonal term; if ai j , the i j th term in the Hessian, satisfies
</p>
<p>|ai j | &gt; |akk | for all k then, as we see in our next example, this also implies that the
critical point is a saddle point.
</p>
<p>It is not necessary to physically interchange these rows and columns as the appro-
</p>
<p>priate sub-matrix can be isolated by inspection but to convince you that this process
</p>
<p>is valid we include this step in our next example.
</p>
<p>Example 4.6 Suppose the Hessian at a critical point P is
</p>
<p>A =
</p>
<p>⎛
</p>
<p>⎜
</p>
<p>⎜
</p>

<p>⎞
</p>
<p>⎟
</p>
<p>⎟
</p>
<p>⎠
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Since the diagonal contains positive and negative terms P is a saddle point. We see
</p>
<p>this more clearly if we interchange row 2 and row 4 and column 2 and column 4.
</p>
<p>We obtain the matrix B below and det(B2) &lt; 0.
</p>
<p>The presence of 9 in the third column suggests we interchange the second and
</p>
<p>third rows and the second and third columns. This gives the matrix C below with
</p>
<p>det(C2) &lt; 0 and confirms that P is a saddle point.</p>

<p>The standard approach gives det(A1) = 2, det(A2) = 2, det(A3) = &minus;171 and
det(A1) det(A3) &lt; 0 implies that P is a saddle point.
</p>
<p>The above method does not identify absolute or global maxima and minima. We
</p>
<p>encountered a similar problem in Example 3.3. We now describe a useful method
</p>
<p>which can be applied to certain functions on convex open sets. A subset U &sub; Rn is
convex if the straight line joining any two points in U is contained in U. The interior
</p>
<p>of a circle, sphere, box, polygon, the first quadrant or octant, and the upper half-plane
</p>
<p>are typical examples of convex open sets. The exterior of a circle or polygon is not
</p>
<p>convex.
</p>
<p>Suppose f : U (open, convex) &minus;&rarr; R has continuous first and second order
partial derivatives at all points. If P, Q &isin; U and v = Q &minus; P then, by convexity,
g(x) = f (P + xv) is defined on an open interval in R and is the restriction of
f to that part of the straight line through P and Q which lies in U. Moreover,
</p>
<p>g&prime;(x) =
&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;v
(P + xv) and
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;v2
(P + xv) = g&prime;&prime;(x). Suppose
</p>

(X) �= 0 for all
</p>
<p>X in U and all v �= 0. By the Intermediate Value Theorem g&prime;&prime;(x) is either always
positive or always negative. This implies that g&prime; is either strictly increasing or strictly
decreasing and in either case g has at most one critical point on every line inU . Since
</p>
<p>we can carry out this analysis for any pair of points P and Q in U this shows that
</p>
<p>f has at most one critical point in U. Suppose f has a local maximum at P. If
</p>
<p>f (P) &lt; f (Q) then the function g considered above must have a local minimum at
</p>
<p>some point on the line joining P and Q. This contradicts the fact that g has at most
</p>
<p>one critical point and shows that f has an absolute maximum over U at P. Similarly
</p>
<p>if f has a local minimum at P then it has an absolute minimum over U at P. To
</p>
<p>verify that
&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;v2
(X) �= 0 when U is a convex open subset in Rn it suffices to show
</p>
<p>that det(H f (x,y)) is never zero.

<p>Example 4.7 Let

<p>f (x, y) = x + y &minus; ex &minus; ey &minus; ex+y

<p>for all (x, y) in R2. We have

<p>&nabla; f (x, y) = (1 &minus; ex &minus; ex+y, 1 &minus; ey &minus; ex+y).
</p>
<p>If (x, y) is a critical point of f then ex = 1 &minus; ex+y = ey and x = y. Hence
e2x + ex &minus; 1 = 0. If w = ex then w2 + w &minus; 1 = 0 and w = (&minus;1 &plusmn;

<p>w = ex &gt; 0 we have only one solution w = (&minus;1+

</p>
<p>point at P = ((&minus;1 +
&radic;
</p>
<p>5)/2, (&minus;1 +

</p>
<p>5)/2). The existence of a single critical point
</p>
<p>suggests that we consider the Hessian at all points. We have</p>

</p>
<p>Curves in Rn
</p>
<p>Summary We introduce and discuss the concept of directed curve inRn . We obtain a
</p>
<p>formula for the length of a curve, prove the existence of unit speed parametrizations
</p>
<p>and define piecewise smooth curves.
</p>
<p>Directed and parametrized curves play a role in many of the topics discussed in the
</p>
<p>remaining chapters of this book, e.g. line integrals, existence of a potential, Stokes&rsquo;
</p>
<p>theorem and the geometry of surfaces in R3, and, furthermore, in a simple fashion
</p>
<p>introduce us to concepts such as parametrizations and orientations that are later
</p>
<p>developed and generalised in more involved settings.
</p>
<p>We begin by giving a rigorous definition of directed curve. This may appear
</p>
<p>complicated and unnecessarily cumbersome at first glance and so we feel it proper to
</p>
<p>elaborate on why each condition is included. It is always important in mathematics
</p>
<p>to understand the basic definition and to refer to it until one appreciates each part
</p>
<p>separately and the totality of parts collectively. As progress is achieved there is usually
</p>
<p>less need to refer to the definition but in case of ambiguity the definition is the book
</p>
<p>of rules. The only requirement in a definition is that it be consistent, i.e. that the
</p>
<p>various conditions do not contradict one another or the rules of mathematics. Apart
</p>
<p>from this there is freedom in the choice of conditions and, indeed, many books would
</p>
<p>give a slightly different definition of directed curve. The differences depend on the
</p>
<p>degree of generality sought, the results aimed at and the methods used. However, all
</p>
<p>definitions of curve, directed curve and parametrized curve contain the same essential
</p>
<p>features.
</p>
<p>Definition 5.1 A directed (or oriented) curve in Rn is a quadruple {Γ, A, B,
v} where Γ is a set of points in Rn ; A and B are points in Γ , called respectively the
initial and final points of Γ ; v is a unit vector in Rn called the initial direction, for
</p>
<p>which there exists a mapping P : [a, b] &rarr; Rn , called a parametrization of Γ , such
that the following conditions hold:
</p>
<p>(a) there exists an open interval I , containing [a, b] and a mapping from I into Rn
which has derivatives of all orders and which coincides with P on [a, b]
</p>
<p>(b) P([a, b]) = Γ , P(a) = A, P(b) = B and P &prime;(a) = αv for some α &gt; 0

<p>(c) P &prime;(t) �= 0 for all t &isin; [a, b]
(d) P is injective (i.e. one to one) on [a, b) and (a, b].
</p>
<p>Condition (a) is a rather strong regularity condition&mdash;we use the first derivative to
</p>
<p>define the tangent, the second to define curvature, the third to define torsion and the
</p>
<p>fourth to obtain the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations, and at this stage we felt it was just as easy
</p>
<p>to assume that we had derivatives of all orders. We also wished to have derivatives
</p>
<p>at the end points of the interval [a, b] and for this reason we assumed that P has
an extension as a smooth function (i.e. as a function with derivatives of all orders)
</p>
<p>to an open interval containing [a, b]. We could achieve precisely the same degree
of smoothness by using one-sided derivatives at a and b but felt this appears even
</p>
<p>more complicated. All definitions of a curve will include, as an essential feature a
</p>
<p>continuousmapping P from an interval I in R ontoΓ . The degree of differentiability,
</p>
<p>whether the interval I is open, closed, finite or infinite may be regarded as options
</p>
<p>that are available. We have chosen the options that suit our purposes.
</p>
<p>The essential feature of condition (b), as we have just noted, is P([a, b]) = Γ .
The remaining parts endow the set Γ with a sense of direction. If A �= B then the
conditions P(a) = A and P(b) = B define a direction along Γ and in this case the
condition P &prime;(a) = αv is redundant as v is determined by {Γ, A, B} (Fig. 5.1).
</p>
<p>If, however, A = B then we have a closed curve, and it is necessary to distinguish
between the two directions we may travel around Γ . In the case of curves in R2 we
</p>
<p>have clockwise and anticlockwise or counterclockwise directions. In Rn we do not
</p>
<p>have such a concept and instead specify the direction along the curve by giving an
</p>
<p>initial direction v (Fig. 5.2).
</p>
<p>Note that when we know Γ and A then v = &plusmn;P &prime;(a)
/
</p>
<p>‖P &prime;(a)‖ and the condition
α &gt; 0 distinguishes between the two signs and fixes the direction. Condition (c) is
</p>
<p>necessary to obtain a unit speed parametrization and we have already used P &prime;(a) �= 0
in (b). This condition excludes curves with corners but we get around this problem</p>

<p>by defining piecewise smooth curves. These are obtained by placing end to end a
</p>
<p>finite number of directed curves. The transition from directed curves to piecewise
</p>
<p>smooth curves is painless. Later we will require P &prime;&prime;(t) �= 0 in order to define a unit
normal to a directed curve in R3.
</p>
<p>Since we allow A = B it follows that the mapping P may not be injective on
[a, b]. However, we do not wish the curve to cross itself (Fig. 5.3a) or to half cross
itself (Fig. 5.3b) as these lead to unnecessary complications and we have included
</p>
<p>condition (d) to exclude such possibilities.
</p>
<p>A continuous mapping P : [a, b] &rarr; Rn which satisfies (a), (c) and (d) is called a
parametrized curve. A parametrized curve determines precisely one directed curve
</p>
<p>{
</p>
<p>P([a, b]), P(a), P(b),
P &prime;(a)
</p>
<p>‖P &prime;(a)‖
</p>
<p>}
</p>
<p>for which it is a parametrization.
</p>
<p>Since the terminology &ldquo;directed curve&rdquo; and the notation {Γ, A, B, v} are rather
cumbersome we will use the term curve and the notation Γ in all cases where there
</p>
<p>is little danger of confusion. If A �= B we sometimes write {Γ, A, B}. If we need to
use coordinates we usually let P(t) =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>x1(t), . . . xn(t)
)
</p>
<p>if Γ &isin; Rn and, when n = 3,
we let P(t) =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>x(t), y(t), z(t)
)
</p>
<p>. It is helpful to think of [a, b] as an interval of time
and P(t) as the position of a particle at time t as it travels along the route Γ from A
</p>
<p>to B.
</p>
<p>We call P &prime;(t) the velocity and ‖P &prime;(t)‖ the speed at time t . Since distance=
speed&times; time the formula

<p>l(Γ ) =
b
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>‖P &prime;(t)‖dt
</p>
<p>where l(Γ ) is the length ofΓ , is not surprising. We shall, however, pause to prove this
</p>
<p>formula in order to show the usefulness of vector notation. Since P is differentiable
</p>
<p>we have for all t and t +∆t in [a, b]
</p>
<p>P(t +∆t) = P(t)+ P &prime;(t)∆t + g(t,∆t) &middot;∆t</p>

<p>Example 5.2 Let P(t) = cos t i + sin tj + tk, t &isin; [0, 2π ], denote a parametrized
curve Γ in R3, where i, j and k denote the standard unit vector basis in R3, i.e.
</p>
<p>i = (1, 0, 0), j = (0, 1, 0) and k = (0, 0, 1). The curve Γ is part of a helix&mdash;it
spirals around a vertical cylinder (Fig. 5.5).
</p>
<p>If we consider only the first two coordinates, this amounts to projecting onto the

<p>The rate of change of the height is given by the coefficient of the k term and so the

</p>
<p>Since the remaining conditions (for a parametrization) are easily checked it fol-
</p>
<p>lows that P ◦ s&minus;1 is a parametrization of Γ and we have proved the following result.
</p>
<p>Proposition 5.3 Directed curves admit unit speed parametrizations.
</p>
<p>If two particles start at the point A at time zero and both proceed along Γ towards
</p>
<p>B at unit speed then their positions onΓ at time t will always agree. This shows that a
</p>
<p>directed curve of length l admits a unique unit speed parametrization on [0, l]. Using
our construction of unit speed curve we may restate this as follows: if P1 : [a, b] &rarr; Γ
and P2 : [c, d] &rarr; Γ are any two parametrizations of the directed curve Γ , of length
l, and
</p>
<p>s1(t) =

</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>c
</p>
<p>‖P &prime;2(x)‖dx
</p>
<p>are the associated length functions then
</p>
<p>P1 ◦ s&minus;11 (t) = P2 ◦ s
&minus;1
2 (t)
</p>
<p>for all t &isin; [0, l].
To include curves with corners we extend the concept of directed curve to
</p>
<p>that of piecewise smooth directed curve. A finite collection of directed curves
</p>
<p>{Γi , Ai , Bi , vi}ni=1 is called a piecewise smooth directed curve if
</p>
<p>(a) each {Γi , Ai , Bi , vi} is a directed curve,
(b) Bi = Ai+1 for i = 1, . . . , n &minus; 1 (i.e. the final point of Γi coincides with the
</p>
<p>initial point of Γi+1).
</p>
<p>If Bn = A1 we say that the piecewise smooth directed curve is closed. We use
the notation Γ for a piecewise smooth directed curve and A and B for its initial and
</p>
<p>final points respectively. This definition is rather general and apart from curves with
</p>
<p>corners it also includes curves which cross one another. In general such curves do not
</p>
<p>admit a unit speed parametrization but it can be shown that there exists a continuous
</p>
<p>parametrization

<p>P : [a, b] &minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; Γ =

<p>Chapter 6
</p>
<p>Line Integrals
</p>
<p>Summary We integrate vector-valued and scalar-valued functions along a directed
</p>
<p>curve in Rn . We discuss scalar and vector potentials and define the curl of a vector
</p>
<p>field in R3.
</p>
<p>The differential calculus was developed to study extremal (i.e. maximal and minimal)
</p>
<p>values of functions. Since it is only possible to discuss the maximum and minimum of
</p>
<p>a real-valued function it is not surprising that such functions occupy a prominent role
</p>
<p>in several-variable differential calculus. However, in moving to integration theory it
</p>
<p>is more natural (and more natural in mathematics usually means more useful, more
</p>
<p>efficient and more elegant) to consider vector-valued functions where the domain
</p>
<p>and the range share, in perhaps a loose way, a common dimension. Formally, we
</p>
<p>have the following definition of a vector field.
</p>
<p>Definition 6.1 A function F which maps a subset U of Rn into Rn is called a vector
</p>
<p>field on U.
</p>
<p>If U is an open subset of Rn and the vector field has derivatives of all orders we
</p>
<p>call it a smooth vector field and if U is arbitrary and the vector field is continuous
</p>
<p>we use the term continuous vector field. We shall also use the notation F to denote a
</p>
<p>vector field.
</p>
<p>The gradient is an important example of a vector field, i.e. if U is open and
</p>
<p>f : U &sub; Rn &rarr; R is differentiable then &nabla; f : U &rarr; Rn is a vector field on U .
Another useful example occurs when Ŵ is a directed curve in Rn and F is a
</p>
<p>function which assigns a vector in Rn to each point on Ŵ&mdash;in this case we say that F
</p>
<p>is a vector field along Ŵ. For example, if P is a parametrization of a directed curve
</p>
<p>Ŵ in Rn then the mapping
</p>
<p>P(t) &isin; Ŵ &rarr; P &prime;(t) &isin; R3
</p>
<p>is a smooth vector field along Ŵ.

<p>Vector fields, which assign vectors to points in the domain of definition, are often
</p>
<p>represented as in Fig. 6.1.
</p>
<p>This representation is useful in locating zeros and suggesting properties such as
</p>
<p>continuity and smoothness. Furthermore, it allows various physical interpretations
</p>
<p>of vector fields, e.g. as the velocity of a moving fluid and the flow of an electric
</p>
<p>current which lead, in turn, to important physical and engineering applications.
</p>
<p>We begin our study of integration theory by defining the integral of a vector field
</p>
<p>F along a directed curve Ŵ. Let P : [a, b] &rarr; Ŵ denote a parametrization of Ŵ. To
each partition of [a, b] we obtain a partition of Ŵ (Fig. 6.2) and the Riemann sum
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>i

)

<p>&middot; P &prime;(ti )�ti
</p>
<p>where �ti = ti+1 &minus; ti and &middot; denotes the inner product in Rn . Note that we are using,
as usual, the linear approximation to P(t+�t), P(t)+ P &prime;(t)�t . If F is a continuous
vector field along Ŵ, i.e. if the mapping t &isin; [a, b] &rarr; F(P(t)) is continuous, then
as we take finer and finer partitions of [a, b] the Riemann sums converge to the limit

</p>
<p>F
(
</p>
<p>P(t)

<p>&middot; P &prime;(t) dt.
</p>
<p>We denote this integral by
&int;
</p>
<p>Ŵ
F , since we shall shortly prove that it is independent of
</p>
<p>the parametrization P , and call it the line integral of F overŴ. In terms of coordinates,</p>

<p>We return to the general situation. If P : [a, b] &rarr; Ŵ and Q : [c, d] &rarr; Ŵ are two

</p>
<p>If P : [a, b] &rarr; Ŵ is a parametrization of the directed curve Ŵ in Rn and t &isin; [a, b]
</p>
<p>let T (t) = P &prime;(t)
/
</p>
<p>‖P &prime;(t)‖. We call T (t) the unit tangent to the (directed) curve

</p>
<p>Real-valued functions or scalar fields, such as the speed of a parametrization,
</p>
<p>can also be defined along a directed curve Ŵ. Since these are not endowed with a
</p>
<p>sense of direction we cannot apply directly our definition of integral. Fortunately, we
</p>
<p>have just observed a special or privileged direction associated with each point on a
</p>
<p>curve, the tangent direction, and by associating the continuous real-valued function
</p>
<p>f : Ŵ &rarr; R with the vector field f T : Ŵ &rarr; Rn we can define
&int;
</p>
<p>Ŵ
f . The privileged
</p>
<p>direction on an oriented surface in R3 is the normal direction and in this case it is

<p>also possible to consider scalar-valued integration as a special case of vector-valued
</p>
<p>integration.

</p>
<p>We now seek to identify those vector fields in Rn which are the gradient of a

F where Ŵ
</p>
<p>is any piecewise smooth directed curve in U joining A to X . By our hypothesis f is

<p>well defined, i.e. there is no ambiguity in the definition. Let F = ( f1, . . . , fn) and
</p>
<p>let Ŵ denote a curve joining A to X . Fix j , 1 &le; j &le; n, and let Y = he j where h
</p>
<p>denotes a real number close to 0. Let Ŵ1 denote the directed curve parametrized by
</p>
<p>P(t) = X + tY , 0 &le; t &le; 1. Then Ŵ1 joins X to X + Y and Ŵ &cup; Ŵ1 is a piecewise

<p>smooth directed curve in U which joins A to X + Y (Fig. 6.3).</p>

</p>
<p>Proposition 6.3 can be used to find potentials but is not very practical for showing
</p>
<p>existence. We need a simpler method which follows from the observation:
</p>
<p>if F = ( f1, . . . , fn) is a continuously differentiable vector field with potential f ,
</p>
<p>i.e. f j =
&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;x j
for all j , then for all i and j
</p>
<p>&part; fi
</p>
<p>&part;x j
=
</p>
<p>&part;
</p>
<p>&part;x j
</p>
<p>( &part; f
</p>
<p>&part;xi
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>=
&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;x j&part;xi
=
</p>
<p>&part;
</p>
<p>&part;xi
</p>
<p>( &part; f
</p>
<p>&part;x j
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>=
&part; f j
</p>
<p>&part;xi
.
</p>
<p>The converse is true for suitable open sets&mdash;the whole space Rn is always suitable
</p>
<p>and so also is any convex set in Rn . In R2 an open set U is suitable if and only
</p>
<p>if the &ldquo;interior&rdquo; of any closed curve in U also lies in U ; roughly speaking this
</p>
<p>means thatU contains no holes. In particular the open set R2\{(0, 0)} is not suitable.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>62 6 Line Integrals
</p>
<p>However, in R3 the whole space with a finite number of points removed is suitable.
</p>
<p>These examples show that the concept of suitability is rather subtle. The proof of the
</p>
<p>following result involves Green&rsquo;s theorem (Chap. 9) and Proposition 6.3.
</p>
<p>Proposition 6.4 If F = ( f1, . . . , fn) is a continuously differentiable vector field on
</p>
<p>a suitable open set in Rn then F has a potential if and only if
</p>
<p>&part; fi
</p>
<p>&part;x j
=
</p>
<p>&part; f j
</p>
<p>&part;xi
(6.2)
</p>
<p>for all i and j .
</p>
<p>Example 6.5 We wish to show that F(x, y, z) = (yez, xez, xyez) has a potential.
</p>
<p>Let F = ( f1, f2, f3). To apply Proposition 6.4 we must verify (6.2), that is we must
</p>
<p>show
&part; f1
</p>
<p>&part;y
=
</p>
<p>&part; f2
</p>
<p>&part;x
,
</p>
<p>&part; f1
</p>
<p>&part;z
=
</p>
<p>&part; f3
</p>
<p>&part;x
,
</p>
<p>&part; f2
</p>
<p>&part;z
=
</p>
<p>&part; f3
</p>
<p>&part;y
.
</p>
<p>We have
</p>
<p>&part; f1
</p>
<p>&part;y
= ez =
</p>
<p>&part; f2
</p>
<p>&part;x
,
</p>
<p>&part; f1
</p>
<p>&part;z
= yez =
</p>
<p>&part; f3
</p>
<p>&part;x
,
</p>
<p>&part; f2
</p>
<p>&part;z
= xez =
</p>
<p>&part; f3
</p>
<p>&part;y
</p>
<p>and hence F has a potential on R3.
</p>
<p>The following is probably the simplest way to find a potential. If f is a potential
</p>
<p>for F then
&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;x
= yez,
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;y
= xez,
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;z
= xyez . (6.3)
</p>
<p>Hence
</p>
<p>f =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;x
dx =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>yez dx = xyez + φ(y, z)
</p>
<p>where φ is the constant of integration with respect to x which may, however, depend
</p>
<p>on y and z. Differentiating with respect to y we get
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;y
= xez +
</p>
<p>&part;φ
</p>
<p>&part;y
</p>
<p>and comparing this with the formula for
&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;y
in (6.3) we have
</p>
<p>xez +
&part;φ
</p>
<p>&part;y
= xez
</p>
<p>and
&part;φ
</p>
<p>&part;y
= 0.</p>

<p>&part; f

<p>f (x, y, z) = xyez + c

<p>for some constant c.

<p>We can also use Proposition 6.3 to find a potential f . This proposition tells us

</p>
<p>piecewise smooth curve Ŵ consisting of three straight lines parallel to the axis Ŵ1,
</p>
<p>Ŵ2, Ŵ3. Specifically we use the following:

<p>Ŵ1 joins (0, 0, 0) to (x, 0, 0), P1(t) = (t, 0, 0), P

1(t) = (1, 0, 0), 0 &le; t &le; x

<p>If F is the velocity of a fluid then curl (F) measures the tendency of the fluid to
</p>
<p>curl or rotate about an axis. Curl(F) gives the direction of the axis of rotation and
</p>
<p>‖curl(F)‖ measures the speed of rotation.
</p>
<p>Since the symbolism &nabla;&times; F has proved useful we consider the analogous symbol
</p>
<p>&nabla; &middot; F where the dot replaces the cross product. This makes sense for a vector field
</p>
<p>on Rn . If F = ( f1, f2, . . . , fn), we let

<p>This is called the divergence of F and written div(F) (see Chap. 15). A vector field

<p>G is a vector potential for the vector field F on the open subset U of R3 if on U we
</p>
<p>have
</p>
<p>curl(G) = &nabla; &times; G = F.
</p>
<p>On &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; open sets a vector field F has a vector potential if and only if &nabla; &middot; F =
</p>
<p>div(F) = 0.
</p>
<p>Example 6.6 We show that F(X) = X

<p>The Frenet&ndash;Serret Equations
</p>
<p>SummaryWediscuss curvature and torsion of directed curves and derive theFrenet&ndash;
</p>
<p>Serret equations. Vector-valued differentiation and orthonormal bases are the main
</p>
<p>tools used.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we define geometric concepts associated with a directed curve and
</p>
<p>derive a set of equations&mdash;the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations&mdash;which capture the funda-
</p>
<p>mental relationships between them.
</p>
<p>We begin with directed curves in R2 since this particular case exhibits special
</p>
<p>features not present in higher dimensions. These are due to considering a one-
</p>
<p>dimensional object (the directed curve) in two-dimensional space, R2. The same
</p>
<p>phenomena appear in Chap. 12 when we examine a two-dimensional object (an ori-
</p>
<p>ented surface) in three-dimensional space, R3, and the same underlying principles
</p>
<p>are present when we introduce torsion later in this chapter. Moreover, our motivation
</p>
<p>and interpretation of normal curvature (Chap. 16) and geodesic curvature (Chap. 18)
</p>
<p>are based on our study of curves in R2. This special straightforward case deserves
</p>
<p>particular attention because of the insight it provides into later developments.
</p>
<p>Let P : [a, b] &rarr; R2 denote a unit speed parametrization of the directed curve Ŵ
and let P(t) =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>x(t), y(t)
)
</p>
<p>for all t in [a, b]. At P(t) &isin; Ŵ the unit tangent, T (t), is
given by
</p>
<p>T (t) = P &prime;(t) =
(
</p>
<p>x &prime;(t), y&prime;(t)
)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>The special features, mentioned above, imply that there are just two unit vectors in R2
</p>
<p>perpendicular to T (t) and using the anticlockwise (or counterclockwise) orientation
</p>
<p>of R2 we can distinguish between them. If we rotate T (t) through +π/2 in an
anticlockwise direction we obtain a unit vector on the left-hand side of the direction
</p>
<p>of motion along Ŵ (Fig. 7.1). We call this unit vector the unit normal to Ŵ at P(t)
</p>
<p>and denote it by N (t). In coordinates
</p>
<p>N (t) =
(
</p>
<p>&minus;y&prime;(t), x &prime;(t)
)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>We have 〈T (t), T (t)〉 = 1 and differentiating we get, by the product rule,

〈T (t), T (t)〉 = 0 = 〈T &prime;(t), T (t)〉 + 〈T (t), T &prime;(t)〉.
</p>
<p>Since
</p>
<p>〈T &prime;(t), T (t)〉 = 〈T (t), T &prime;(t)〉
</p>
<p>this implies
</p>
<p>〈T &prime;(t), T (t)〉 = 0.
</p>
<p>Hence T &prime;(t) is perpendicular to T (t) and, using once more the fact that R2 is two-
dimensional, we see that T &prime;(t) is parallel to N (t). The curvature of Ŵ at P(t) is
defined as the unique scalar, κ(t), satisfying
</p>
<p>T &prime;(t) = κ(t)N (t). (7.1)

<p>|κ(t)| = ‖T &prime;(t)‖ = ‖P &prime;&prime;(t)‖. (7.3)
</p>
<p>Example 7.1 Let P : [a, b] &rarr; R2 denote an arbitrary parametrization of the
directed curve Ŵ. We recall from Chap. 5 that P ◦ s&minus;1 : [0, l] &rarr; Ŵ is a unit speed
parametrization of Ŵ where l is the length of Ŵ and s is the length function. If

<p>&middot; (s&minus;1)&prime;&prime;(t)
</p>
<p>and analogous formulae for (y ◦ s&minus;1)&prime;(t) and (y ◦ s&minus;1)&prime;&prime;(t). Substituting these into
(7.2) and simplifying we obtain the curvature at the point P(t), t &isin; [a, b],

<p>. (7.4)
</p>
<p>If Ŵ is the graph of a smooth function f : [a, b] &rarr; R directed from left to right
then P(t) =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>t, f (t)
)
</p>
<p>, t &isin; [a, b], is a parametrization of Ŵ. This parametrization
is only unit speed in the trivial case of a horizontal line (why?). Since x(t) = t we
have x &prime;(t) = 1 and x &prime;&prime;(t) = 0 and as y(t) = f (t) we obtain y&prime;(t) = f &prime;(t) and
y&prime;&prime;(t) = f &prime;&prime;(t). Hence the curvature at
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>t, f (t)
)
</p>
<p>is
</p>
<p>κ(t) =
f &prime;&prime;(t)
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1 + f &prime;(t)2
)3/2
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>We now discuss the geometric significance of curvature. Let P denote a unit speed
</p>
<p>parametrization of the directed curve Ŵ. For simplicity we suppose 0 &isin; [a, b], the
domain of definition of P . If t is close to zero then
</p>
<p>P(t) = P(0)+ P &prime;(0)t + P &prime;&prime;(0)
t2
</p>
<p>2
+ g(t)t2 (7.5)
</p>
<p>where g(t) &rarr; 0 as t &rarr; 0. Since P &prime;(0) = T (0) and P &prime;&prime;(0) = T &prime;(0) = κ(0)N (0)
we can rewrite this as
</p>
<p>P(t) = P(0)+ T (0)t + κ(0)N (0)
t2
</p>
<p>2
+ g(t)t2.

<p>is the best quadratic approximation to Ŵ near P(0) and the curve, parametrized by
</p>
<p>Q, has the same tangent, the same normal and the same curvature as Ŵ at P(0).
</p>
<p>By translating and rotating the plane, if necessary, we can suppose P(0) = (0, 0),
T (0) = (1, 0) and N (0) = (0, 1). This implies Q(t) = (t, κ(0)t2/2) and, if κ(0) 	=
0, then one of the two situations portrayed in Fig. 7.2 holds.
</p>
<p>Let Ct denote the circle with centre (at , bt ) which passes through the points
</p>
<p>Q(&minus;t), Q(0), Q(t). By symmetry (at , bt ) lies on the y-axis, hence at = 0 and |bt |
is the radius of Ct . As t tends to zero the circles Ct converge to a circle C with centre
</p>
<p>(0, b) and radius |b|. This is the circle of curvature at Q(0) to the directed curve
parametrized by Q. Since P(t)&minus;Q(t)
</p>
<p>t2
&rarr; 0 as t &rarr; 0 it can easily be shown that C
</p>
<p>is also the circle of curvature to Ŵ at P(0), i.e. the circle that fits closest to Ŵ near
</p>
<p>P(0). The centre (0, b) is called the centre of curvature of Ŵ at P(0) and |b| is the
radius of curvature.
</p>
<p>We have
</p>
<p>b2t = ‖(0, bt )&minus; (t, κ(0)t2/2)‖2 = t2 + (bt &minus; κ(0)t2/2)2.
</p>
<p>Hence
</p>
<p>b2t = t2 + b2t &minus; btκ(0)t2 + κ(0)2t4/4
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>btκ(0) = 1 +
κ(0)2t2

.
</p>
<p>Letting t tend to zero we get bκ(0) = 1. We interpret |κ(0)| as

</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>radius of circle of curvature

we have</p>

</p>
<p>κ(0) &lt; 0 &lArr;&rArr; the circle of curvature and the normal lie
on opposi te sides of Ŵ(Fig.7.2b).
</p>
<p>If κ(0) = 0 then Ŵ is rather flat near P(0) and the circle of curvature has infinite
radius and thus is a straight line&mdash;in our case the x-axis.
</p>
<p>We have thus established a geometric interpretation for both absolute curvature
</p>
<p>and the sign of curvature in R2 and this often yields immediate and useful information.
</p>
<p>For example, consider the ellipse in Fig. 7.3, oriented in an anticlockwise direction.
</p>
<p>The normal will always point into the ellipse and is called, for this reason, the inner
</p>
<p>normal. Since the circle of curvature at any point has finite radius and lies on the
</p>
<p>same side of the tangent line as the curve the curvature is always strictly positive.
</p>
<p>At the points A and C the circles of closest fit to the ellipse have minimum radii
</p>
<p>among all points on the ellipse. Hence we have maximum curvature at A and C and,
</p>
<p>similarly, minimum curvature at B and D.
</p>
<p>Now consider a directed curve Ŵ in Rn , n &gt; 2, with unit speed parametrization
</p>
<p>P : [a, b] &rarr; Ŵ. As before the unit tangent to Ŵ at P(t) is P &prime;(t) = T (t). We
cannot, however, define the unit normal to Ŵ at P(t) by rotating T (t) since there
</p>
<p>are not just two but an infinite number of sides to Ŵ and thus an infinite number
</p>
<p>of ways of choosing a unit vector perpendicular to T (t). Even if there were only
</p>
<p>two directions we would require some concept of anticlockwise direction in Rn to
</p>
<p>distinguish between them.
</p>
<p>To define a normal we need to choose a direction perpendicular to T which is
</p>
<p>associated in some way to the curve Ŵ. We still have 〈T (t), T (t)〉 = 1 for all t
in [a, b] and differentiating, as we did previously, we get 〈T &prime;(t), T (t)〉 = 0. We
have found a special vector, T &prime;(t), perpendicular to T (t) and if this is non-zero (or
equivalently if P &prime;&prime;(t) 	= 0) we define the unit normal, N (t), by
</p>
<p>N (t) =
T &prime;(t)
</p>
<p>‖T &prime;(t)‖
.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>74 7 The Frenet&ndash;Serret Equations
</p>
<p>We define the curvature κ(t) by κ(t) = ‖T &prime;(t)‖. Thus the normal is only defined at
points of non-zero curvature and at such points we obtain the equation
</p>
<p>T &prime;(t) = κ(t)N (t). (7.1&prime;)
</p>
<p>Note that (7.1&prime;) and (7.1) are the same equation. However, (7.1) applies to a curve
in R2 while (7.1&prime;), which is the first of the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations when n = 3,
applies to a curve in Rn . The definitions of curvature and normal are different in
</p>
<p>these two equations. The technique of using an equation in a simple setting to extend
</p>
<p>a definition to a more general setting is standard and useful in mathematics.
</p>
<p>Now that we have defined κ and N in Rn we must investigate their properties
</p>
<p>as they could well be different to those in R2. Using the same terminology is an
</p>
<p>expression of our aspirations but does not qualify as a proof. We note first that
</p>
<p>curvature in Rn is always defined and always non-negative but certain curves, such
</p>
<p>as straight lines, do not have a normal.
</p>
<p>Equation (7.5) and the approximation (7.6) are still valid for curves in Rn and
</p>
<p>the same analysis shows that κ(t) can be interpreted as the reciprocal of the radius
</p>
<p>of the circle of curvature to Ŵ at P(t). Hence curvature in Rn , n &gt; 2, has the same
</p>
<p>geometrical interpretation as absolute curvature in R2. We have seen that the sign
</p>
<p>of curvature in R2 was related to the different sides of a curve and, in view of our
</p>
<p>previous remarks, it is not surprising that it does not feature when n &gt; 2.
</p>
<p>From now on we restrict ourselves to curves in R3. The approximation
</p>
<p>Q(t) = P(0)+ T (0)t + κ(0)N (0)
t2
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>near 0 &isin; [a, b] is still valid and shows that the plane (or two-dimensional subspace) in
R
</p>
<p>3 closest to the curve near P(t) is the plane through P(t) spanned by {T (t), N (t)}.
We call this the osculating plane of the curve at P(t). We may consider the osculating
</p>
<p>plane as the two-dimensional analogue of the tangent line. As we move along the
</p>
<p>curve the osculating plane will generally change and the more it changes the more
</p>
<p>twisted the curve. We measure this by defining a new concept&mdash;torsion&mdash;which we
</p>
<p>denote by τ . We define torsion and a third unit vector, the binormal in R3, in a fashion
</p>
<p>similar to the way we introduced curvature and the normal for curves in R2. At each
</p>
<p>point on the directed curve Ŵ in R3 we have obtained two perpendicular unit vectors
</p>
<p>T and N and these span a two-dimensional subspace of R3. Hence there are precisely
</p>
<p>two unit vectors perpendicular to T and N . To choose one of these unambiguously

<p>we require a sense of direction or orientation in R3. This will also be important in
</p>
<p>integration theory. The basis of this sense of direction is known as &ldquo;the right-hand
</p>
<p>rule&rdquo; and we describe it in the special case in which we are interested. Use the right
</p>
<p>thumb as the vector T and the first finger in place of N . Then the second finger will,
</p>
<p>when put perpendicular to T and N , give the direction of the binormal, B (Fig. 7.4).
</p>
<p>Think of T and N as determining the flat plane of this page. This page has two

</p>
<p>Mathematically, we can find the binormal by using the cross product in R3. For

<p>a directed curve Ŵ in R3 with parametrization P , unit tangent T (t) and unit normal
</p>
<p>N (t) the binormal at the point P(t) is given by
</p>
<p>B(t) = T (t)&times; N (t).

<p>To derive further results we list standard properties of the cross product&mdash;all of which

<p>follow easily from well-known results about determinants.

<p>them an orthonormal basis (&ldquo;ortho&rdquo; comes from orthogonal or perpendicular and
</p>
<p>normal comes from the fact that they are unit vectors). Another orthonormal basis
</p>
<p>for R3 is the set {i, j,k}. We consider {T (t), N (t), B(t)} as a special basis which is
adapted to studying the curve Ŵ near P(t). As t varies the basis {T (t), N (t), B(t)}
changes and is called a moving frame along the curve (see Fig. 7.5).
</p>
<p>Since N (t)&times; B(t) is easily seen to be a unit vector perpendicular to both N and
B we must have
</p>
<p>N (t)&times; B(t) = &plusmn;T (t).
</p>
<p>Hence
</p>
<p>T (t) &middot; N (t)&times; B(t) = &plusmn;T (t) &middot; T (t) = &plusmn;1

</p>
<p>B(t) &middot; T (t)&times; N (t) = B(t) &middot; B(t) = 1
</p>
<p>and N (t)&times;B(t) = T (t). Similarly B(t)&times;T (t) = N (t) and, using (a), the remaining
cross products involving T , N and B can be found.
</p>
<p>The simplest way to remember these is to use the diagram shown in Fig. 7.6. The
</p>
<p>cross product of any two taken in an anticlockwise direction is the one that follows
</p>
<p>it, e.g. N&times; B = T . If we work in a clockwise direction we get, from (a), the negative
of the following one, e.g. N &times; T = &minus;B.
</p>
<p>We are now in a position to make effective use of the orthonormal basis {T, N , B}.
Since it is a basis any vector v can be written in the form
</p>
<p>v = αT + βN + γ B</p>

<p>for some real numbers α, β and γ . If we take the inner product of both sides with

</p>
<p>Similarly β = 〈v, N 〉 and γ = 〈v, B〉 and thus
</p>
<p>v = 〈v, T 〉T + 〈v, N 〉N + 〈v, B〉B. (7.7)
</p>
<p>We also note, although we do not require it here, that Pythagoras&rsquo; Theorem implies
</p>
<p>‖v‖2 = 〈v, T 〉2 + 〈v, N 〉2 + 〈v, B〉2.
</p>
<p>We use vector-valued differentiation to find B &prime;(t). Since ‖B(t)‖ = 1 we have
〈B(t), B(t)〉 = 1 and hence
</p>
<p>0 =
d
</p>
<p>dt
〈B(t), B(t)〉 = 〈B &prime;(t), B(t)〉 + 〈B(t), B &prime;(t)〉
</p>
<p>= 2〈B &prime;(t), B(t)〉. (7.8)
</p>
<p>Since 〈B(t), T (t)〉 = 0 we get, in the same way,
</p>
<p>0 =
d
</p>
<p>dt
〈B(t), T (t)〉
</p>
<p>= 〈B &prime;(t), T (t)〉 + 〈B(t), T &prime;(t)〉
= 〈B &prime;(t), T (t)〉 + 〈B(t), κ(t)N (t)〉 (by (7.1&prime;))
= 〈B &prime;(t), T (t)〉 + κ(t)〈B(t), N (t)〉
= 〈B &prime;(t), T (t)〉 (sinceB &perp; N ). (7.9)
</p>
<p>Replacing v by B &prime;(t) in (7.7) and using (7.8) and (7.9) we have
</p>
<p>B &prime;(t) = 〈B &prime;(t), N (t)〉N (t)
</p>
<p>i.e. B &prime;(t) is parallel to N (t). We use this equation to define the torsion of Ŵ at P(t),
τ(t), by letting1
</p>
<p>τ(t) = &minus;〈B &prime;(t), N (t)〉
</p>
<p>and obtain another of the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations
</p>
<p>B &prime;(t) = &minus;τ(t)N (t). (7.10)

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>78 7 The Frenet&ndash;Serret Equations
</p>
<p>We discuss the geometric significance of torsion in Chap. 8 but note at this point
</p>
<p>that B(t) is normal to the osculating plane and hence torsion is a measure of the rate
</p>
<p>of change of the osculating plane.
</p>
<p>We have found T &prime; and B &prime; in Eqs. (7.1&prime;) and (7.10) for a directed curve in R3 and
the remaining Frenet&ndash;Serret equation is an expression for N &prime; in terms of the basis
{T, N , B}. To find N &prime; we differentiate the equation N = B &times; T using the product
rule. We have
</p>
<p>N &prime; = B &prime; &times; T + B &times; T &prime; = &minus;τN &times; T + B &times; κN = τT &times; N &minus; κN &times; B.
</p>
<p>Since T &times; N = B and N &times; B = T we obtain for all t the equation
</p>
<p>N &prime;(t) = &minus;κ(t)T (t)+ τ(t)B(t). (7.11)
</p>
<p>Equations (7.1&prime;), (7.10) and (7.11) which express T &prime;, N &prime; and B &prime; in terms of T , N and
B are known as the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations and contain, for all practical purposes,
</p>
<p>complete information on the curve (see also Example 8.5). The set {T, N , B, κ, τ }
is known as the Frenet&ndash;Serret apparatus of the curve Ŵ. It is important to remember
</p>
<p>that whenever we discuss normals to curves in R3 or the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations for
</p>
<p>a curve we assuming the curvature is strictly positive.

<p>Certain classical curves are not covered by Definition 5.1 and we encounter one of
</p>
<p>these&mdash;the helix&mdash;in our next example. In its natural state the helix does not have an
</p>
<p>initial or final point and is usually parametrized over R. The reader should have little
</p>
<p>difficulty analysing such curves by the methods we have already developed. Essen-
</p>
<p>tially one examines different finite parts of the curve in turn&mdash;for example consider
</p>
<p>how we treated a part of the helix in Example 5.2. For the sake of completeness,
</p>
<p>however, we mention how our definition of parametrized curve can be extended in
</p>
<p>the following natural way to include such curves:
</p>
<p>a continuous mapping P : I &minus;&rarr; Rn , I an interval in R, is a parametrized curve
if for every closed interval [a, b] &sub; I the restriction of P to [a, b] satisfies (a), (c)
and (d) of Definition 5.1.

<p>Geometry of Curves in R3
</p>
<p>Summary We apply the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations to study the geometric significance
</p>
<p>of torsion, to analyse curves in spheres and to characterise generalised helices.
</p>
<p>We first provide a geometrical interpretation of zero torsion.
</p>
<p>Proposition 8.1 If Γ is a directed curve in R3 with positive curvature at all points
</p>
<p>then the following are equivalent
</p>
<p>(a) Γ is a plane curve.
</p>
<p>(b) the function t &rarr; B(t) is constant.
(c) τ(t) = 0 for all t .
</p>
<p>Proof Since κ(t) &gt; 0, N (t) is defined. By the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations B &prime;(t) =
&minus;τ(t)N (t) and since ‖N (t)‖ = 1 we have:
</p>
<p>B(t) is independent of t &lArr;&rArr; B &prime;(t) = 0 &lArr;&rArr; τ(t) = 0.
</p>
<p>Hence (b) and (c) are equivalent. Now suppose Γ is a plane curve, i.e. there
</p>
<p>exists a plane in R3 which contains Γ . Then there exists a unit vector A in R3 and
</p>
<p>a real number c such that Γ &sub; {X &isin; R3 : X &middot; A = c}. Let P denote a unit speed
parametrization of Γ with domain [a, b]. For all t &isin; [a, b], P(t) &middot; A = c. We have
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
(P(t) &middot; A) = T (t) &middot; A = 0
</p>
<p>and
d2
</p>
<p>dt2
P(t) &middot; A = T &prime;(t) &middot; A = κ(t)N (t) &middot; A = 0.
</p>
<p>Hence A is perpendicular to both T (t) and N (t) and B(t) = &plusmn;A for all t . Suppose
B(t1) = A and B(t2) = &minus;A. The mapping g : t &minus;&rarr; B(t) &middot; A is a continuous real-
valued function on [a, b], g(t) = &plusmn;1 for all t , g(t1) = 1 and g(t2) = &minus;1. This
is impossible, since it would imply, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, that there
</p>
<p>exists t0 &isin; (a, b) such that g(t0) = 0. Hence g(t) = +1 for all t or g(t) = &minus;1 for

<p>all t and this implies B(t) = A for all t or B(t) = &minus;A for all t . In either case B is a
constant function and (a) =&rArr; (b).
</p>
<p>Now suppose (b) holds. Let P denote a unit speed parametrization of Γ with
</p>
<p>domain [a, b]. If t0 &isin; (a, b), X0 = P(t0) and B(t) = B for all t , then

</p>
<p>= 〈T (t), B(t)〉 + 0
= 0 (since T (t) &perp; B(t)).
</p>
<p>Hence there exists a constant c such that
</p>
<p>〈P(t)&minus; X0, B〉 = c
</p>
<p>and P lies in the plane through X0 perpendicular to B. This shows that (b) =&rArr; (a)
and completes the proof. �
</p>
<p>Proposition 8.1 gives a precise geometric interpretation of zero torsion. To inter-
</p>
<p>pret non-zero torsion we look at an expansion of the parametrization P about a fixed
</p>
<p>point relative to the basis {T (t0), N (t0), B(t0)}. For convenience we may suppose
t0 = 0.
</p>
<p>In Chap. 7 we obtained, using orthogonality, the Taylor series expansion and the
</p>
<p>Frenet&ndash;Serret equations, the following three expansions of P(t):
</p>
<p>P(t) = 〈P(t), T (0)〉T (0)+ 〈P(t), N (0)〉N (0)+ 〈P(t), B(0)〉B(0) (8.1)
</p>
<p>= P(0)+ P &prime;(0)t + P &prime;&prime;(0)

</p>
<p>= P(0)+ T (0)t +
κ(0)N (0)
</p>
<p>2
t2 + g(t)t2 (8.3)
</p>
<p>where g(t) &rarr; 0 in R3 as t &rarr; 0. From (8.3) we can identify the main influence&mdash;the
first non-constant term in the Taylor series expansion&mdash;on the shape of the curve in
</p>
<p>the T (0) and N (0) directions. Comparing (8.1&ndash;8.3) we see also that the first possi-
</p>
<p>ble non-zero term in the B(0) direction will be

〈P &prime;&prime;(t), B(0)〉 = 〈T &prime;(t), B(0)〉 = 〈κ(t)N (t), B(0)〉

<p>Letting t = 0 we get

<p>called the Frenet approximation to the curve Γ at 0. The Frenet approximation is
</p>
<p>clearly a refinement of (8.3) which takes account of torsion. The function t &rarr; Q(t)
defines a parametrized curve which has the same Frenet&ndash;Serret apparatus as the
</p>
<p>original curve at P(0). From the Frenet approximation we see the influence of non-
</p>
<p>zero torsion on the shape of the curve. Torsion controls the motion of the curve
</p>
<p>orthogonal to the osculating plane. If τ(0) &gt; 0 then the curve twists towards the
</p>
<p>side of the osculating plane which contains B(0) and the greater τ(0) the more
</p>
<p>dramatic the twist. If τ(0) &lt; 0 the curve twists towards &minus;B(0).
An everyday example of non-zero torsion is given by the curve on the edge of a
</p>
<p>screw. In tightening a screw one usually uses the right-hand and follows the right-
</p>
<p>hand rule while in loosening a screw one follows the left-hand rule. If you have
</p>
<p>any doubts about the difference change hands. This also illustrates the two different
</p>
<p>orientations of R3.
</p>
<p>Example 8.2 In this example we study a directed curve Γ which lies in a sphere
</p>
<p>with centre c and radius r . Let P denote a unit speed parametrization of Γ . Our
</p>
<p>hypothesis states that
</p>
<p>‖P(t)&minus; c‖2 = 〈P(t)&minus; c, P(t)&minus; c〉 = r2.
</p>
<p>Consider the expansion of P(t) &minus; c relative to the orthonormal basis {T (t),
N (t), B(t)}, i.e.
</p>
<p>P(t)&minus; c = 〈P(t)&minus; c, T (t)〉T (t)+ 〈P(t)&minus; c, N (t)〉N (t)
+ 〈P(t)&minus; c, B(t)〉B(t). (8.4)
</p>
<p>Differentiating we get
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
〈P(t)&minus; c, P(t)&minus; c〉 = 0 = 2〈P(t)&minus; c, P &prime;(t)〉 .
</p>
<p>Since P is unit speed, P &prime;(t) = T (t), and we may restate this as follows:
</p>
<p>〈P(t)&minus; c, T (t)〉 = 0. (8.5)</p>

= τ(t)〈P(t)&minus; c, B(t)〉 (by (8.5)).
</p>
<p>If τ(t0) �= 0 for some t0 then, by continuity, τ(t) �= 0 for all t near t0 and

</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Hence we have recovered the radius of the sphere from the curvature and torsion
</p>
<p>when we know that the curve lies in a sphere. In particular, we see that r2 &ge; 1/κ(t)2,
or κ(t) &ge; 1/r , which we may loosely rephrase as saying that a curve in a sphere is
at least as curved as the sphere in which it lies.
</p>
<p>If τ(t) = 0 for all t in an open interval I then the above implies that κ(t) is constant
on I . Since a plane circle has constant curvature, Proposition 8.1 and Example 8.5
</p>
<p>imply that the part ofΓ parametrized by restricting P to I is part of a circle contained
</p>
<p>in a plane in R3.
</p>
<p>Example 8.3 The helix in Example 7.2 satisfies 〈Tp, (0, 0, 1)〉 = hω for all p where
Tp is the unit tangent at the point p. We generalise this by defining a generalised</p>

</p>
<p>helix in R3, as a curve Γ of positive curvature (at all points) for which there exists a
</p>
<p>unit vector u in R3 such that
</p>
<p>〈Tp,u〉 = c (constant)
</p>
<p>for all p &isin; Γ . Let P denote a unit speed parametrization of the generalised helix
Γ and let {T (t), N (t), B(t), κ(t), τ (t)} denote the Frenet&ndash;Serret apparatus at P(t).
We prove the following characterisation:
</p>
<p>Γ is a generalised helix &lArr;&rArr;
τ(t)
</p>
<p>κ(t)
is constant (i.e. independent of t).
</p>
<p>Since 〈T (t),u〉 is constant it follows, by the Cauchy&ndash;Schwarz inequality
(Example 3.4), that
</p>
<p>|〈T (t),u〉| &le; ‖T (t)‖ &middot; ‖u‖ &le; 1
</p>
<p>and 〈T (t),u〉 = cos θ for some θ . If θ = nπ then, by the equality case in the
Cauchy&ndash;Schwarz inequality, T (t) = &plusmn;u. By the Intermediate Value Theorem (see
the proof of Proposition 8.1) this implies that T (t) is a constant function of t . Hence
</p>
<p>T &prime;(t) = 0 and this contradicts our hypothesis. We thus have 〈T (t),u〉 = cos θ for
some θ �= nπ . Again using the orthonormal basis {T (t), N (t), B(t)} we have
</p>
<p>u = 〈u, T (t)〉T (t)+ 〈u, N (t)〉N (t)+ 〈u, B(t)〉B(t).
</p>
<p>Since 〈T (t),u〉 = cos θ
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>〈T (t),u〉
)
</p>
<p>= 0 = 〈T &prime;(t),u〉 + 〈T (t), (u)&prime;〉 = 〈κ(t)N (t),u〉
</p>
<p>(since u is a constant, (u)&prime; = 0). By our hypothesis κ(t) �= 0 and this implies
〈u, N (t)〉 = 0. Hence
</p>
<p>u = cos θT (t)+ sin θB(t).
</p>
<p>A further application of the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations implies
</p>
<p>0 =
d
</p>
<p>dt
u = cos θT &prime;(t)+ sin θB &prime;(t)

=
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>cos θκ(t)&minus; sin θτ(t)
)
</p>
<p>N (t).
</p>
<p>Since ‖N (t)‖ = 1 this implies cos θκ(t) = sin θτ(t) and
</p>
<p>τ(t)
</p>
<p>κ(t)
=
</p>
<p>cos θ
</p>
<p>sin θ
= cot θ.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>88 8 Geometry of Curves in R3
</p>
<p>We have shown τ(t)/κ(t) is constant for any generalised helix. In obtaining this
</p>
<p>result we obtained a formula for u and now use this to prove the converse. Let Γ
</p>
<p>denote a directed curve with non-zero curvature in R3 such that τ(t)/κ(t) is constant
</p>
<p>(i.e. independent of t). This hypothesis implies that there exists a real number θ ,
</p>
<p>0 &lt; θ &lt; π , such that cot θ = τ(t)/κ(t) for all t (note that θ does not depend on t).
Let
</p>
<p>u(t) = cos θ T (t)+ sin θ B(t).
</p>
<p>By Pythagoras&rsquo; theorem ‖u‖2 = cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1 and u is a unit vector. To
show that u does not depend on t we prove
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>u(t)
)
</p>
<p>= 0. By the Frenet&ndash;Serret
equations

</p>

</p>
<p>=
(
</p>
<p>κ(t) cos θ &minus; τ(t) sin θ
)
</p>
<p>N (t) = 0.
</p>
<p>Hence u does not depend on t and so is a constant. Moreover, since T &perp; B,
</p>
<p>〈T (t),u〉 = 〈T (t), cos θ T (t)+ sin θ B(t)〉 = cos θ.
</p>
<p>This shows that Γ is a generalised helix and justifies our claim.
</p>
<p>Our analysis so far applies to unit speed parametrizations of a directed curve.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many natural parametrizations of curves are not unit speed. It is thus
</p>
<p>useful to be able to calculate the Frenet&ndash;Serret apparatus directly from an arbitrary
</p>
<p>parametrization.
</p>
<p>Let P : [a, b] &rarr; R3 denote an arbitrary parametrization of the directed curve
Γ . We suppose P &prime;(t) and P &prime;&prime;(t) are both non-zero for all t . Let s : [a, b] &rarr; [0, l]
denote the length function associated with P (see Chap. 5). Then l is the length of
</p>
<p>Γ , ‖P &prime;(t)‖ = s&prime;(t) and Q := P ◦ s&minus;1 is a unit speed parametrization of Γ . Let
{T (t), N (t), B(t), κ(t), τ (t)} denote the Frenet&ndash;Serret apparatus at the point P(t)
on Γ . We have
</p>
<p>Q ◦ s(t) = P ◦ s&minus;1 ◦ s(t) = P(t).

<p>Example 8.5 In Example 8.2 we showed that curvature and torsion together allowed
</p>
<p>us to deduce properties of spherical curves. In this example we show that curvature
</p>
<p>and torsion completely determine the shape of a curve in R3. LetΓ andΓ1 denote two
</p>
<p>directed curves having the same length l in R3. We suppose that both have positive
</p>
<p>curvature. Now transfer Γ1 so that its initial point coincides with the initial point of
</p>
<p>Γ and rotate it so that the tangents, normals and binormals of Γ and Γ1 coincide at
</p>
<p>the initial point. These operations do not affect the shape of Γ1. Let P : [0, l] &rarr; Γ
and P1 : [0, l] &rarr; Γ1 denote unit speed parametrizations. We now suppose that the
curvature and torsion of Γ and Γ1 at P(t) and P1(t) coincide for all t and thus we
</p>
<p>have the Frenet&ndash;Serret apparatus {T, N , B, κ, τ } and {T1, N1, B1, κ, τ } for Γ and
Γ1 respectively. Using the dot product in R
</p>
<p>3 we define g: [0, l] &rarr; R by
</p>
<p>g(t) = T (t) &middot; T1(t)+ N (t) &middot; N1(t)+ B(t) &middot; B1(t).
</p>
<p>By our hypothesis g(0) = 3 and by the Cauchy&ndash;Schwarz inequality (Example 3.4)
&minus;3 &le; g(t) &le; 3 for all t and g(t) = 3 if and only if T (t) = T1(t), N (t) = N1(t) and
B(t) = B1(t). From the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations
</p>
<p>g&prime; = κN &middot;T1+κT &middot;N1+(&minus;κT+τ B)&middot;N1+N &middot;(&minus;κT1+τ B1)&minus;τN &middot;B1&minus;τ B &middot;N1 = 0.
</p>
<p>Hence g is a constant mapping and, since g(0) = 3, we have g(t) = 3 for all t
and the Frenet&ndash;Serret apparatus is the same for both curves. In particular
</p>
<p>(P &minus; P1)&prime;(t) = P &prime;(t)&minus; P &prime;1(t) = T (t)&minus; T1(t) = 0</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>92 8 Geometry of Curves in R3
</p>
<p>and P(t) = P1(t)+ C for all t . Since P(0) = P1(0) this implies P(t) = P1(t) for
all t and one curve lies on top of the other. We conclude that Γ and Γ1 have the same
</p>
<p>shape.

<p>Double Integration
</p>
<p>Summary We define the double integral of a function over an open subset of R2 and
</p>
<p>use Fubini&rsquo;s theorem to evaluate such integrals. We discuss the fundamental theorem
</p>
<p>of calculus in R2&mdash;Green&rsquo;s theorem.
</p>
<p>We discuss (double) integration of a real-valued function of two variables f (x, y)
</p>
<p>over an open set Ω in R2. Motivated by the one-dimensional theory we divide Ω
</p>
<p>into rectangles&mdash;the natural analogue of intervals&mdash;by first drawing horizontal and
</p>
<p>vertical lines and thus partitioning the x- and y-axes.
</p>
<p>Let xi denote a typical element of the partition of the the x-axis and let y j be a
</p>
<p>typical element on the y-axis. The resulting grid of rectangles gives a partition of Ω
</p>
<p>(Fig. 9.1) and we form the Riemann sum
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>j
</p>
<p>f (xi , y j ) &middot;∆xi &middot;∆y j , ∆xi = xi+1 &minus; xi , ∆y j = y j+1 &minus; y j
</p>
<p>where we sum over all rectangles which are strictly contained in Ω . If this sum tends
</p>
<p>to a limit as we take finer and finer partitions we say that f is integrable overΩ and
</p>
<p>denote the limit by &int;&int;
</p>
<p>Ω
</p>
<p>f (x, y) dxdy.
</p>
<p>We call this the integral (or double integral) of f over Ω . If Ω is the inside of a
</p>
<p>closed curve Γ and f is continuous onΩ it can be shown that f is integrable over Ω .
</p>
<p>When f (x, y) = 1 for all (x, y) &isin; Ω the Riemann sum is the area of the rectangles
in the partition inside Γ and on taking a limit we obtain
</p>
<p>&int;&int;
</p>
<p>Ω
</p>
<p>dxdy = Area of Ω.

</p>
<p>We only evaluate double integrals over rather simple open sets. An open set is said

<p>to be of type I if it is bounded above by the graph of a continuous function y = h(x),
bounded below by the graph of a continuous function y = g(x) and on the left and
right by vertical lines of finite length (see Fig. 9.2).

</p>
<p>This method of integration, together with the similar method obtained by reversing
</p>
<p>the roles of x and y, is known as Fubini&rsquo;s theorem. We define an open set to be of
</p>
<p>type II if it is bounded on the left and right by the graphs of continuous functions of
</p>
<p>y, k and l, which are defined on the interval [c, d] and above and below by horizontal
lines of finite length. For domains of type II Fubini&rsquo;s theorem is

<p>k(y)
</p>
<p>f (x, y) dx
</p>
<p>}
dy.
</p>
<p>If we are given an open set we recognise it is of type I if each vertical line cuts the
</p>
<p>boundary at two points except possibly at the end points and type II if each horizontal
</p>
<p>line cuts the boundary at two points except, perhaps, at the end points.

</p>
<p>type II and we have a choice of method, i.e. we can integrate first with respect to</p>

<p>either variable. Our choice may be important since one method may be very simple
</p>
<p>and the other quite difficult.
</p>
<p>We have to evaluate two integrals of a single variable. In the first integral, the
</p>
<p>inner integral, one of the variables takes a fixed value and is really a constant. Thus
</p>
<p>we have to first evaluate either
</p>
<p>&int;
x dx or
</p>
<p>&int;
dy&radic;
</p>
<p>16 + y7
.
</p>
<p>In these situations looks are usually not deceiving and we opt for the simpler looking
</p>
<p>integral. So, we choose to integrate first with respect to x . The limits of integration
</p>
<p>in the first integral will influence the degree of difficulty that arises in evaluating
</p>
<p>the second, or outer, integral. If you run into problems with the second integral you
</p>
<p>should consider starting again using a different order of integration. In our case we
</p>
<p>have decided to consider
</p>
<p>&int; { &int;
x&radic;
</p>
<p>16 + y7
dx
</p>
<p>}
dy
</p>
<p>and now need to determine the variation in x for fixed y. We draw a typical line
</p>
<p>through Ω on which y is constant&mdash;i.e. a horizontal line.
</p>
<p>We must now express the end points in terms of y. Using once more Fig. 9.3
</p>
<p>we see that the end points of the line of variation of x are (0, y) and (x, y) where
</p>
<p>y = x1/3. Hence y3 = x and we have the required variation of x (Fig. 9.4).
We see also that y varies from 0 to 2. Hence

<p>between the orientations on the two sides of (9.1). The fundamental theorem of two-
</p>
<p>variable calculus is known asGreen&rsquo;s theorem. To obtain this result by an immediate
</p>
<p>application of the one-variable theorem it is usual to begin with an open subset Ω in
</p>
<p>R
2 which is of type I and type II. In applying (9.1) it is necessary to be careful with
</p>
<p>signs and this means that in Green&rsquo;s theorem the boundary of Ω , Γ , is oriented in
</p>
<p>an anticlockwise or counterclockwise direction.
</p>
<p>Theorem 9.3 (Green&rsquo;s Theorem) Let P and Q denote real-valued functions with
</p>
<p>continuous first-order partial derivatives on the open subset U of R2. If Γ is a
</p>
<p>closed curve directed in an anticlockwise direction such that the interior (inside)Ω

<p>Parametrized Surfaces in R3
</p>
<p>Summary We discuss theoretical and practical approaches to parametrizing a sur-
</p>
<p>face in R3.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we begin a systematic study of surfaces in R3, a topic which will
</p>
<p>occupy the remaining chapters of this book. We begin with an informal discussion
</p>
<p>of the background we bring to this investigation and reveal our general intentions.
</p>
<p>Daily we encounter most of the classical Euclidean surfaces in R3 such as a
</p>
<p>sphere (football, globe), cone (ice-cream cone), ellipsoid (egg, American foot-
</p>
<p>ball), cylinder (jar, can), plane (floor, wall, ceiling) and the non-Euclidean torus
</p>
<p>(doughnut, tube). Many of our examples involve these surfaces and a solid geo-
</p>
<p>metric understanding of these should be deliberately cultivated. Initially these
</p>
<p>surfaces are merely subsets of R3 which have a certain recognisable shape. We
</p>
<p>have already established mathematical contact with them as level sets and graphs
</p>
<p>of functions. Our studies have been confined to the classical problem in
</p>
<p>differential calculus of finding the maximum and minimum of a scalar-valued func-
</p>
<p>tion over a surface and for this we introduced the geometric concepts of tan-
</p>
<p>gent plane and normal line. This essentially summarises the formal knowledge
</p>
<p>we have acquired but we do have at our disposal a range of mathematical ideas
</p>
<p>and techniques which, if not directly applicable, will often hint at the way for-
</p>
<p>ward.
</p>
<p>Our plan is to develop integration theory on surfaces and to investigate the geom-
</p>
<p>etry of surfaces. Keep in mind the following topics as particularly relevant to the
</p>
<p>theories we develop:
</p>
<p>(a) integration over open subsets of R2 (Chap. 9)
</p>
<p>(b) integration along directed curves in R2 and R3 (Chap. 6)
</p>
<p>(c) the geometry of curves in R2 and R3 (Chaps. 7 and 8).
</p>
<p>For instance an open subsetU in R2 can be considered, or identified with, a surface
</p>
<p>Ũ in R3 by means of the mapping
</p>
<p>(x, y) &isin; U &minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; (x, y, 0) &isin; Ũ.

</p>
<p>Thus any theory of integration over a surface will extend integration theory over
</p>
<p>open subsets of R2. We can say more since parametrizations (Definition 10.2) are a
</p>
<p>means of identifying a simple surface with an open subset of R2 and this eventually
</p>
<p>allows us to reduce integration over a surface to integration over an open subset of
</p>
<p>R
2 in much the same way that we reduced line integrals in Rn to integration over
</p>
<p>an interval in R (the key word in this sentence is unfortunately &ldquo;eventually&rdquo;). Thus
</p>
<p>our theory of integration over surfaces is obtained by combining and developing
</p>
<p>techniques already used in (a) and (b). We shall see later how (b) and (c) and, in
</p>
<p>particular, the methods used to derive the Frenet&ndash;Serret equations, can be extended
</p>
<p>to investigate the geometry of surfaces in R3.
</p>
<p>We begin our formal study of surfaces by defining the concept of a parametrized
</p>
<p>surface in R3. Our definition is mathematically simple, a good starting point, and
</p>
<p>carries us a long way but does have certain inadequacies that we discuss as we
</p>
<p>proceed.
</p>
<p>Definition 10.1 A parametrized surface in R3 consists of a pair (S, φ) where S is
</p>
<p>a subset of R3 and φ is a bijective mapping from an open subset of R2 onto S such
</p>
<p>that the following conditions hold:
</p>
<p>(i) φ has derivatives of all orders (we say that φ is smooth or C&infin;)
(ii) φx &times; φy �= 0 at all points.
</p>
<p>Condition (ii) is the analogue of P&prime; �= 0 for a parametrized curve in R3 and is
equivalent to the requirement that φx and φy are linearly independent vectors at all
</p>
<p>points (see Fig. 10.1).
</p>
<p>Definition 10.2 A simple surface in R3 is a subset S of R3 for which there exists a
</p>
<p>mapping φ such that (S, φ) is a parametrized surface. We call φ a parametrization of
</p>
<p>S.
</p>
<p>One notable difference between the above definitions and the corresponding def-
</p>
<p>inition of directed curve (Definition 5.1) is the change from a closed interval in R
</p>
<p>to an open subset of R2 for the domain of parametrization. For a directed curve the
</p>
<p>inclusion of end points in the domain of definition leads to a sense of direction along
</p>
<p>the curve and we will need an analogous concept, a sense of orientation, to develop
</p>
<p>vector-valued integration theory over a surface. However, a sense of direction along a</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 Parametrized Surfaces in R3 105
</p>
<p>curve can also be obtained by using tangent vectors at interior points of the curve and
</p>
<p>we develop the concept we require for surfaces by using the interior of the surface.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the classical Euclidean surfaces, e.g. the sphere, are not
</p>
<p>simple surfaces but, fortunately, for many practical purposes, e.g. the calculation of
</p>
<p>surface area and the evaluation of surface integrals, they may be considered as simple
</p>
<p>surfaces. We will make this precise later and also define a general surface in R3.
</p>
<p>We now examine three specific examples&mdash;graphs, surfaces of revolution and
</p>
<p>the classical ellipsoid. These, although apparently rather limited, appear in many
</p>
<p>different contexts and we allow them to divert us to essential ideas associated with
</p>
<p>any parametrized surface.
</p>
<p>Example 10.3 (see Example 7.1) Let f : U &sub; R2 &rarr; R denote a smooth function
defined on the open subset U of R2 and let S denote the graph of f , i.e.
</p>
<p>S =
{(
x, y, f (x, y)
</p>
<p>)
: (x, y) &isin; U
</p>
<p>}
.
</p>
<p>The form of S immediately gives a parametrization φ defined by
</p>
<p>φ(x, y) =
(
x, y, f (x, y)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>with domain U. Since φx = (1, 0, fx) and φy = (0, 1, fy) we have
</p>
<p>φx &times; φy =
</p>
<p>∣∣∣∣∣∣
</p>
<p>i j k
</p>
<p>1 0 fx
</p>
<p>0 1 fy
</p>
<p>∣∣∣∣∣∣
= (&minus;fx,&minus;fy, 1).
</p>
<p>As the final coordinate of φx &times; φy is always 1 we have φx &times; φy �= 0. If φ(x1, y1) =
φ(x2, y2) then (
</p>
<p>x1, y1, f (x1, y1)
)
=
</p>
<p>(
x2, y2, f (x2, y2)
</p>
<p>)
.
</p>
<p>Hence x1 = x2 and y1 = y2 and so φ is injective. Clearly φ(U) = S.
</p>
<p>As a particular example consider the unit sphere S : x2 + y2 + z2 = 1. We have
z2 = 1 &minus; x2 &minus; y2 and z = &plusmn;(1 &minus; x2 &minus; y2)1/2. Hence the upper hemisphere of S is
the graph of the function
</p>
<p>g(x, y) = (1 &minus; x2 &minus; y2)1/2
</p>
<p>and the mapping g̃ : (x, y) &rarr;
(
x, y, (1&minus;x2&minus;y2)1/2
</p>
<p>)
is a parametrization of the upper
</p>
<p>hemisphere. The domain of g̃ is the disc {(x, y) &isin; R2 : x2 + y2 &lt; 1}. To visualise
this physically imagine the hemisphere as a dome S and take U to be the floor of
</p>
<p>the dome. If you can now accept yourself as a point p on the floor and look directly
</p>
<p>upwards your eyes will focus on a unique point q in the dome S (Fig. 10.2). Moving
</p>
<p>around you will be identifying the points of U with points of the surface. The floor U
</p>
<p>is the domain of the parametrization while the parametrization itself is the mapping
</p>
<p>which takes p to q. The fact that you are always looking in the same direction means</p>

</p>
<p>that the identification or parametrization is given by a set of parallel lines (Fig. 10.2)
</p>
<p>and since parallel lines never meet the mapping is injective or one-to-one. Since each
</p>
<p>point on the dome is hit by an arrow we also have an onto or surjective mapping
</p>
<p>and thus a bijective mapping. In general any natural identification of a flat set with a
</p>
<p>surface by means of parallel lines will lead to a parametrization (see Example 11.2).
</p>
<p>A point P in R2 can be identified by means of its distance r from the origin and
</p>
<p>the angle θ between the positive x-axis and the vector OP (Fig. 10.3).
</p>
<p>We call (r, θ) the polar coordinates of P. Polar coordinates are particularly useful
</p>
<p>when dealing with circles and discs and with functions involving the expression
</p>
<p>x2 + y2 in Cartesian coordinates. Unfortunately, the correspondence
</p>
<p>(r, θ)&minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; (x, y) = (r cos θ, r sin θ)
</p>
<p>is not bijective but we get around this difficulty by removing a small portion of the
</p>
<p>domain. The domain of the parametrization of the hemisphere S given above is the
</p>
<p>disc x2 + y2 &lt; 1 and suggests the use of polar coordinates. Since

<p>We suppose y(t) &gt; 0 for all t. The surface obtained by revolving this curve about

<p>Consider a typical point on the circle obtained by rotating the point

<p>10 Parametrized Surfaces in R3 109
</p>
<p>We now examine in considerable detail a particular surface&mdash;the standard ellip-
</p>
<p>soid. This includes the sphere as a special case. We use this example as an excuse
</p>
<p>to explore and comment on many of the practical and theoretical considerations that
</p>
<p>arise in studying any surface and to shed some light on the necessity and significance
</p>
<p>of later developments. In studying this example the reader should keep in mind that
</p>
<p>parametrizations are nothing more than coordinate systems, that we are always trying
</p>
<p>to interpret mathematical facts geometrically and constantly attempting to articulate
</p>
<p>mathematically our geometric observations.
</p>
<p>Example 10.5 We consider the ellipsoid

<p>b2

</p>
<p>z2
</p>
<p>c2
= 1.
</p>
<p>This specialises to the sphere of radius a centred at the origin when a = b = c.
Two of the most frequently used coordinate systems on the sphere are spherical
</p>
<p>polar coordinates and geographical coordinates. These, as we shall see, are closely
</p>
<p>related. Spherical polar coordinates are more popular in the mathematical literature
</p>
<p>but since geographical coordinates are in everyone&rsquo;s normal experience we devote
</p>
<p>more time to them here.
</p>
<p>The representation of the ellipsoid as a level set of a sum of squares suggests
</p>
<p>we use the elementary identity sin2 θ + cos2 θ = 1 to develop our parametrization.
Rewriting the formula for the ellipsoid as a sum of two squares we get

<p>a cos θ

<p>but we must specify U, check that F is bijective and see that conditions (i) and (ii)
</p>
<p>are satisfied. Geometrically we have the following diagram (Fig. 10.6) in the case of
</p>
<p>the sphere a = b = c.
Thus we project the point P = (x, y, z) onto the xy-plane to get the point Q =
</p>
<p>(x, y, 0). The angle θ is the angle between the vectors OQ and OP and hence θ =
tan&minus;1

<p>(
z
</p>
<p>/
(x2 + y2)1/2
</p>
<p>)
. The level set of the surface through P parallel to the xy-
</p>
<p>plane is a circle (remember we are just considering a sphere here) and this is also
</p>
<p>projected onto the xy-plane and the angle ψ is obtained by using polar coordinates
</p>
<p>on this circle. Hence ψ = tan&minus;1(y/x). From Fig. 10.6 it is clear that θ ranges over
the interval (&minus;π/2, π/2) and ψ over the interval (0, 2π). Clearly the smoothness
condition (i) is satisfied no matter what domainU we choose forF. In many examples
</p>
<p>condition (ii) is easily checked and formal identification of the range of F is obtained
</p>
<p>using a diagram. In this example, however, we adopt a more analytic approach in
</p>
<p>verifying that F is a parametrization.

<p>We have

<p>Before proceeding we make a brief observation which we develop in more detail
</p>
<p>in Chaps. 16&ndash;18. If we fix ψ and let θ vary we obtain a mapping
</p>
<p>θ &minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; F(θ, ψ)
</p>
<p>where θ ranges over an interval in R. This defines a directed curve which lies in S with
</p>
<p>tangent Fθ . Similarly Fψ is tangent to the curve ψ &rarr; F(θ, ψ) in S. These curves
are called coordinate curves (of the parametrization). The vectors Fθ and Fψ lie in
</p>
<p>the tangent space of S at P and are called tangent vectors. Tangent vectors enable us
</p>
<p>to define directional derivatives of functions defined on the surface. If G : S &rarr; Rn
and P &isin; S then the directional derivative of G at P in the direction of the tangent
vector v at P is given by
</p>
<p>DvG(p) =
d
</p>
<p>dt
(G ◦ φ)(t)|t=0
</p>
<p>where φ is any differentiable mapping from (&minus;a, a) into S such that φ(0) = P and
φ&prime;(0) = v.

</p>
<p>the normal is parallel to &nabla;g and by inspecting (10.1) we see that &nabla;g(P) is parallel to
Fθ (P)&times;Fψ (P). This observation can be used to partially check calculations and, in
some cases, may even be used to avoid calculating Fφ &times; Fψ . We have thus related
our earlier concepts of tangent space and normal with terms which can be calculated
</p>
<p>from any parametrization.
</p>
<p>We next turn to find a domainU forF and to verify that all requirements necessary
</p>
<p>for a parametrization are satisfied by (F,U). Initially, it is usually better to choose
</p>
<p>the domain of parametrization to be as large and as simple as possible. These twin
</p>
<p>aims may not always be compatible with the requirements for a parametrization or,
</p>
<p>indeed, with one another so some judgement is necessary and this usually comes
</p>
<p>with experience.
</p>
<p>By (10.1),Fθ&times;Fψ �= 0 if and only if cos θ �= 0 and a natural choice for the domain
of θ is the interval &minus;π/2 &lt; θ &lt; π/2. This is also suggested by Fig. 10.6. Since both
the sine and cosine functions have period 2π the length of the interval of definition
</p>
<p>of ψ cannot be greater than 2π . The interval (0, 2π) is a natural choice and leads to
</p>
<p>U = {(θ, ψ) : &minus;π/2 &lt; θ &lt; π/2, 0 &lt; ψ &lt; 2π}
</p>
<p>as our domain for F. Clearly the set U is open. If F(θ1, ψ1) = F(θ2, ψ2) then,
comparing final coordinates in F, we get sin θ1 = sin θ2. Since the sine function is
injective on (&minus;π/2, π/2) this implies θ1 = θ2. Moreover, cos θ �= 0 on (&minus;π/2, π/2)
and comparing the first two coordinates of F we see that cosψ1 = cosψ2 and
sinψ1 = sinψ2. Since (cos(ψ), sin(ψ)), 0 &lt; ψ &lt; 2π, are the coordinates of a
unique point on the unit circle we have ψ1 = ψ2 and F is injective on U.
</p>
<p>We have thus shown that F is a parametrization of its range or image, F(U). By
</p>
<p>our construction the image ofF lies in the ellipsoid. Does it cover the full ellipsoid? If
</p>
<p>F(θ, ψ) = (0, 0, c) then sin θ = 1. However, &minus;π/2 &lt; θ &lt; π/2, and so (0, 0, c) /&isin;
F(U) and F does not cover the ellipsoid. To find the range of F we proceed as
</p>
<p>follows. The set U is an open rectangle in R2 and its boundary is the perimeter of
</p>
<p>this rectangle. The function F has a nice smooth extension from U to its boundary
</p>
<p>(Fig. 10.7) and the image of this boundary is the boundary of the image of F in the
</p>
<p>surface we are examining.

<p>Since F(θ, 0) = F(θ, 2π) = (&minus;a cos θ, 0, c sin θ), F(π/2, ψ) = (0, 0, c),
F(&minus;π/2, ψ) = (0, 0,&minus;c), and&minus;π/2 &lt; θ &lt; π/2 the boundary ofU is mapped onto
one half of the ellipse (x/a)2+(z/c)2 = 1, y = 0. HenceF is a parametrization of the
ellipsoid with one curve removed, the half ellipse PQR in Fig. 10.8. As we develop
</p>
<p>geometric insight we will find that a good sketch often leads to a rapid identification
</p>
<p>of the domain of definition of the parametrization and it will not be necessary to go
</p>
<p>through the protracted investigation we have just completed.
</p>
<p>A different choice of domain would have led to a parametrization which almost
</p>
<p>certainly would have covered a different part of the ellipsoid and perhaps covered
</p>
<p>the curve that we missed. However, no parametrization will cover the full ellipsoid.
</p>
<p>This, although intuitively clear, is a highly non-trivial mathematical result.
</p>
<p>A parametrization identifies, with F as the mode of identification, a flat set of
</p>
<p>points, the open subset U of R2, with a subset of the surface, F(U), in a one-to-one
</p>
<p>fashion. So essentially we are taking a sheet of paper U and using F to wrap it around
</p>
<p>a sphere. The first stage of wrapping turns the sheet of paper into a cylinder with
</p>
<p>the sphere inside it (Fig. 10.9). This identifies the boundary lines I and II with one
</p>
<p>another (Fig. 10.7) and is equivalent mathematically to F(θ, 0) = F(θ, 2π) for all θ .
The final steps in the wrapping collapses III onto (0, 0, c) and IV onto (0, 0,&minus;c).
</p>
<p>Mathematically this says F(π/2, ψ) = (0, 0, c) and F(&minus;π/2, ψ) = (0, 0,&minus;c) for</p>

<p>Fig. 10.10
</p>
<p>all ψ . We thus see geometrically that if we include the boundary of U in the domain
</p>
<p>of F then the curve, which we previously missed, is covered twice and F is not
</p>
<p>one-to-one. If we do not include the boundary then this curve is not in the image of
</p>
<p>F.
</p>
<p>Next we discuss parametrizations as coordinate systems. A useful initial approach
</p>
<p>to any such system is to sketch and examine the coordinate curves on the surface. In
</p>
<p>our case, since we are still looking at the unit sphere, we consider the curves obtained
</p>
<p>by fixing one of the variables of the function
</p>
<p>F(θ, ψ) = (cos θ cosψ, cos θ sinψ, sin θ), &minus;π/2 &lt; θ &lt; π/2, 0 &lt; ψ &lt; 2π.
</p>
<p>Since F is bijective, a point on the surface corresponds to a unique pair (θ1, ψ1)
</p>
<p>and F(θ1, ψ1) is the point of intersection of the coordinate curves θ &rarr; F(θ, ψ1),
ψ &rarr; F(θ1, ψ). For this reason, the pair (θ, ψ) is often referred to as the curvilinear
coordinates of the pointF(θ, ψ). Fixing θ is clearly equivalent to taking a fixed value
</p>
<p>of z and amounts to taking a cross-section of the unit sphere parallel to the xy-plane.
</p>
<p>Geometrically we get a circle (Fig. 10.10).
</p>
<p>This may also be seen analytically since the mapping F(θ, ψ) can be written as
</p>
<p>(0, 0, sin θ)+ cos θ(cosψ, sinψ, 0).
</p>
<p>As ψ varies over (0, 2π) we get a circle (with one point removed) in a plane parallel
</p>
<p>to the xy-plane, with centre (0, 0, sin θ) on the z-axis, and radius cos θ . A number of
</p>
<p>level sets of θ are given in Fig. 10.11.
</p>
<p>Now fix ψ and let θ range over the interval &minus;π/2 &lt; θ &lt; π/2. We have
</p>
<p>F(θ, ψ) = cos θ(cosψ, sinψ, 0)+ sin θ(0, 0, 1).
</p>
<p>Since (cosψ, sinψ, 0) and (0, 0, 1) are perpendicular unit vectors we get, by
</p>
<p>Pythagoras&rsquo; theorem, a semicircle of radius 1. We do not get the full circle because
</p>
<p>of the restricted range of θ . This is easily seen, either geometrically or from
</p>
<p>the above formula, to be a semicircle running from (&minus;1, 0, 0) to (+1, 0, 0), i.e.</p>

</p>
<p>One can find a ready-made example of this by examining a globe representing
</p>
<p>the Earth. The level sets of θ are the lines or parallels of latitude with the equator
</p>
<p>corresponding to θ = 0. Instead of + and &minus; the terms North and South are used. The
level sets of ψ are called lines of longitude or meridians with the level set ψ = 0
going through Greenwich, England. In place of + and &minus; we use East and West (of
Greenwich). The range here is from 0 to 180◦ while for θ we use 0 to 90◦. If we
represent the Earth on a map we are unwrapping the sphere, or mathematically, taking
</p>
<p>the inverse of a parametrization. The most common map (Fig. 10.13) is obtained by
</p>
<p>using Mercator&rsquo;s projection. This first unwraps the sphere onto a cylinder in such a
</p>
<p>way that when the cylinder is unrolled shapes are preserved (but area is distorted&mdash;see

<p>Exercise 11.8). What happens if we replace the cylinder by a cone?
</p>
<p>Note that East meets West on the International Date Line in the middle of the
</p>
<p>Pacific Ocean. There is a certain ambiguity about this line&mdash;is it 180◦ East or 180◦
</p>

<p>Different maps result from using different parametrizations or coordinate systems.
</p>
<p>The mapping F that we have been discussing is called the geographical coordinate
</p>
<p>system. It is as useful and as intuitive a system as the more popular spherical polar
</p>
<p>coordinate system that we now discuss.
</p>
<p>A small change in our method of introducing geographical coordinates leads to
</p>
<p>the definition of spherical polar coordinates. Recall that, for the ellipsoid, we have
</p>
<p>(( x2
a2
</p>
<p>+
y2
</p>
<p>b2
</p>
<p>)1/2)2
+
</p>
<p>( z
c
</p>
<p>)2
= 1.
</p>
<p>Now we interchange the role of sine and cosine and let
</p>
<p>z
</p>
<p>c
= cos θ and
</p>
<p>( x2
a2
</p>
<p>+
y2
</p>
<p>b2
</p>
<p>)1/2
= sin θ.
</p>
<p>This implies ( x
a sin θ
</p>
<p>)2
+
</p>
<p>( y
b sin θ
</p>
<p>)2
= 1 .
</p>
<p>Let x/a sin θ = cosψ and y/b sin θ = sinψ . This defines the mapping
</p>
<p>G(θ, ψ) = (a sin θ cosψ, b sin θ sinψ, c cos θ)
</p>
<p>which are the spherical polar coordinates of the point (x, y, z).
</p>
<p>From Fig. 10.14 we see that 0 &lt; θ &lt; π and 0 &lt; ψ &lt; 2π . The angle θ is called
</p>
<p>the colatitude and ψ is sometimes called the azimuth. Note that we obtain the same
</p>
<p>two sets of coordinate curves for geographical and spherical polar coordinates&mdash;the
</p>
<p>labelling is, however, different.
</p>
<p>For a sphere of radius r with centre at the origin this gives
</p>
<p>G(θ, ψ) = (r sin θ cosψ, r sin θ sinψ, r cos θ).</p>

<p>If we wish to parametrize a part of the sphere we can still use G&mdash;and hence all cal-
</p>
<p>culations involving G and its derivatives&mdash;but it is necessary to identify the restricted
</p>
<p>domain on which we are working. Fig. 10.14 is useful for this purpose. Suppose, for
</p>
<p>instance, we wish to parametrize that portion of the sphere of radius 5 with centre at
</p>
<p>the origin which lies between the planes z = &minus;3 and z = 4.
Figure 10.15a and b gives the minimum and maximum values of θ , θ1 and θ2, and
</p>
<p>there is no restriction on ψ . Hence our parametrization G has domain

</p>
<p>This completes our analysis of the ellipsoid and sphere. We remark that many of our
</p>
<p>comments apply to a wide variety of surfaces.
</p>
<p>A simple surface may have different parametrizations and depending on the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances one may be more useful than another. In Examples 10.3 and 10.4 we
</p>
<p>derived other parametrizations for the &ldquo;sphere&rdquo;. An important technique that we
</p>
<p>discuss in Chap. 14 is how to go from one parametrization to another. Since para-
</p>
<p>metrizations are coordinate systems involving variables this process is known as a
</p>
<p>change of variable.
</p>
<p>In the above discussion we have seen that ellipsoids and spheres are not simple
</p>
<p>surfaces, although they may be written as a union of a simple surface and a para-
</p>
<p>metrized curve and for practical purposes, such as integration, they may be regarded
</p>
<p>as simple surfaces. Nevertheless, it is desirable to have a definition of surface in R3
</p>
<p>which implies, for instance, that a sphere is a surface. Such a definition, as we have
</p>
<p>just noted, requires more than one parametrization.</p>

<p>10 Parametrized Surfaces in R3 119
</p>
<p>Definition 10.6 A subset of R3 is a surface if it can be covered by a collection of
</p>
<p>(generally overlapping) simple surfaces.
</p>
<p>With the aid of the following important and highly non-trivial result we outline
</p>
<p>a relationship between surfaces, simple surfaces, level sets and graphs. This also
</p>
<p>shows that an ellipsoid is a surface.
</p>
<p>Theorem 10.7 (Inverse Mapping Theorem.) If F : U(open)&sub; Rn &minus;&rarr; Rn is con-
tinuously differentiable and F &prime;(p) is invertible at p &isin; U then there exist V and W
open in Rn, p &isin; V , such that the restriction of F to V defines a bijective mapping
from V onto W with continuously differentiable inverse.
</p>
<p>Theorem 10.8 If S is a subset of R3 then the following are equivalent:
</p>
<p>1. S is a surface,
</p>
<p>2. for each P &isin; S there exists ε &gt; 0 such that S &cap; {X : ‖X &minus; P‖ &lt; ε} is a simple
surface,
</p>
<p>3. for each P &isin; S there exists ε &gt; 0 such that S &cap; {X : ‖X &minus; P‖ &lt; ε} is the graph
of a smooth function,
</p>
<p>4. for each P &isin; S there exists ε &gt; 0 and a smooth function f : {X : ‖X &minus; P‖ &lt;
ε} &minus;&rarr; R such that &nabla;f (X) �= 0 for ‖X &minus; P‖ &lt; ε and
</p>
<p>S &cap; {X : ‖X &minus; P‖ &lt; ε} = {X : ‖X &minus; P‖ &lt; ε, f (X) = 0}.
</p>
<p>Proof The first two conditions are equivalent by Definition 10.6. By Example 1.7,
</p>
<p>graphs are level sets and, by the Implicit Function Theorem (Theorem 2.1), level sets
</p>
<p>are locally graphs and the final two conditions are also equivalent. By Example 10.3
</p>
<p>every graph is a simple surface and thus it suffices to show that every simple surface
</p>
<p>is locally a level set.
</p>
<p>Suppose φ : U(open in R2) &minus;&rarr; S is a parameterized surface. Define F : U &times;
R &minus;&rarr; R3 by letting
</p>
<p>F(x, y, z) = φ(x, y)+ zG(x, y)
</p>
<p>where G(x, y, z) = φx(x, y)&times; φy(x, y). Then F is continuously differentiable and
</p>
<p>F &prime;(x, y, 0) = [φx(x, y), φy(x, y),G(x, y)]
</p>
<p>is invertible. If P &isin; S then, by the Inverse Mapping Theorem, we can find open
subsets of R3,V and W , such that P &isin; W ,F(V) = W and F restricted to V has
a continuously differentiable inverse. Let g = π3 ◦ F&minus;1 where π3(x, y, z) = z. If
(x, y, z) &isin; W , then for a unique (x&prime;, y&prime;, z&prime;) &isin; V we have
</p>
<p>(x, y, z) = F(x&prime;, y&prime;, z&prime;) = φ(x&prime;, y&prime;)+ G(x&prime;, y&prime;)z&prime;.
</p>
<p>This implies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>120 10 Parametrized Surfaces in R3
</p>
<p>g(x, y, z) = π3 ◦ F&minus;1(x, y, z) = 0 &lArr;&rArr; π3 ◦ F&minus;1 ◦ F(x&prime;, y&prime;, z&prime;) = z&prime; = 0
&lArr;&rArr; (x, y, z) = F(x&prime;, y&prime;, 0) = φ(x&prime;, y&prime;)
&lArr;&rArr; (x, y, z) &isin; S
</p>
<p>and hence g&minus;1(0)&cap;W = S &cap;W . Since &nabla;g(X) �= 0 for all X &isin; W this completes the
proof. ⊓⊔
</p>
<p>The above shows that graphs are much more than simple examples. This will
</p>
<p>become very evident when we examine curvature in the final three chapters.

<p>Surface Area
</p>
<p>Summary We define and calculate surface area.
</p>
<p>We follow the method used in Chap. 5 to calculate the length of a curve in order
</p>
<p>to define the (surface) area of a simple surface S in R3. Let φ : U &rarr; S denote
a parametrization of S where U is an open subset of R2. We take a rectangular
</p>
<p>partition of U (Fig. 11.1), find the approximate area of the image of each rectangle
</p>
<p>in the partition, form a Riemann sum and obtain the surface area as the limit of the
</p>
<p>Riemann sums.
</p>
<p>If R denotes a typical rectangle in U (Fig. 11.2) then
</p>
<p>φ(x +�x, y)&minus; φ(x, y) &asymp; φx(x, y)�x
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>φ(x, y +�y)&minus; φ(x, y) &asymp; φy(x, y)�y.
</p>
<p>If θ = θ(x, y) is the angle between φx(x, y) and φy(x, y) then using the well-known
formula for the area of a triangle, 1

<p>as we take finer and finer partitions of U. Hence the surface area of S, A(S), has the

</p>
<p>A(S) =
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>U
</p>
<p>‖φx &times; φy‖ dxdy
</p>
<p>and is calculated using a parametrization. In general, a surface will admit many
</p>
<p>different parametrizations but, as we will see later, they all give the same value
</p>
<p>for surface area. In this chapter we are using the usual physical idea of area and
</p>
<p>angle. These non-negative absolute quantities do not require a sense of direction or
</p>
<p>orientation on the surface and lead, as we have just seen, to a relatively straightforward
</p>
<p>form of integration. In the next chapter we require more sophisticated concepts of
</p>
<p>area and angle to integrate vector fields over a surface.
</p>
<p>We now obtain another formula for surface area which avoids the cross product.
</p>
<p>We maintain the notation φ : U &rarr; S for our parametrization and introduce, in their
traditional form, three quantities that make regular and important appearances in the
</p>
<p>remaining chapters of this book. Let
</p>
<p>E (or E(x, y)) = φx &middot; φx = ‖φx‖2
</p>
<p>F (or F(x, y)) = φx &middot; φy
G (or G(x, y)) = φy &middot; φy = ‖φy‖2.
</p>
<p>We have
</p>
<p>‖φx &times; φy‖2 = ‖φx‖2‖φy‖2 sin2 δ</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11 Surface Area 123
</p>
<p>where δ is the angle between φx and φy. Hence
</p>
<p>cos δ =
φx &middot; φy
</p>
<p>‖φx‖ &middot; ‖φy‖
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>‖φx &times; φy‖2 = ‖φx‖2‖φy‖2(1 &minus; cos2 δ)

<p>= ‖φx‖2‖φy‖2
(

</p>
<p>‖φx‖2‖φy‖2
)
</p>
<p>= ‖φx‖2‖φy‖2 &minus; (φx &middot; φy)2 = EG&minus; F2.
</p>
<p>This gives the following useful formula for surface area
</p>
<p>A(S) =
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>U
</p>
<p>&radic;
EG&minus; F2 dxdy.
</p>
<p>Figure 11.2 shows how E, F and G quantify the distortion of a rectangle by the
</p>
<p>parametrization. The stretching or contraction of the sides is measured by E and G
</p>
<p>while F measures the change in angle. Thus we see that shape is preserved if E = G
and F = 0 while (relative) area is preserved if EG &minus; F2 is constant. For many
important parametrizations, including geographical and spherical polar coordinates,
</p>
<p>F = 0. This implies that angles between curves are preserved and, in particular,
parallels (of latitude) and meridians (of longitude) cross one another at right angles.
</p>
<p>For geographical coordinates on a sphere of radius r, E = r2 and G = r2 cos2 θ and
hence neither shape nor area are preserved. On the Equator, where θ = 0, we have
E = G = r2 but as one moves towards the North and South Poles, θ &rarr; &plusmn;π/2 and
G &rarr; 0 while E = r2. Consequently, near the Equator shape is fairly well preserved
but as one moves towards the polar regions it becomes more and more distorted.
</p>
<p>Mercator&rsquo;s projection is a modification of geographical coordinates&mdash;notice how the
</p>
<p>lines of latitude in Fig. 10.13 are not equally spaced in order to preserve shape. If the
</p>
<p>cylinder in Mercator&rsquo;s construction is replaced by a cone we obtain Lambert&rsquo;s equal
</p>
<p>area projection which preserves (relative) area but distorts shape and distance.
</p>
<p>In Chap. 10 we noted that many well-known surfaces S could be written in the
</p>
<p>form S = S1 &cup; Ŵ where S1 is a simple surface and Ŵ is a curve parametrized by a
smooth function on a closed interval. We see now that the surface area of Ŵ is zero
</p>
<p>and from this conclude that A(S) = A(S1) and thus we may use a parametrization of
S1 to calculate the surface area of S. To show A(Ŵ) = 0 enclose Ŵ in a finite union
of rectangles of small width ε (Fig. 11.3).
</p>
<p>The sum of the lengths of the rectangles is approximately the length of Ŵ, l(Ŵ).
</p>
<p>Hence
</p>
<p>A(Ŵ) &asymp; ε &times; l(Ŵ).</p>

<p>although our intuition might suggest otherwise, since there is a famous example of
</p>
<p>a square filling curve parametrized by a continuous function.
</p>
<p>Example 11.1 In this example we consider the surface of revolution S parametrized
</p>
<p>as in Example 10.4. Let P : [a, b] &rarr; R2 denote a parametrization of the curve to be
revolved. Our parametrization φ of S is defined on U = {(t, θ) : a &lt; t &lt; b, 0 &lt;
θ &lt; 2π} and has the form
</p>
<p>φ(t, θ) =
(
x(t), y(t) cos θ, y(t) sin θ
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>where P(t) =
(
x(t), y(t)
</p>
<p>)
. We have already shown in Example 10.4 that
</p>
<p>‖φt &times; φθ‖ = y(t)‖P&prime;(t)‖
</p>
<p>and so the surface area of S is

<p>We now parametrize the torus by realising it as a surface of revolution. We adopt a
</p>
<p>slightly different approach to that in Example 10.4 in order to obtain what is regarded
</p>
<p>as the standard parametrization. Place a circle of radius r in the (y, z)-plane with
</p>
<p>centre on the y-axis at a distance b, r &gt; b, from the origin and revolve this circle
</p>
<p>about the z-axis (Fig. 11.4).
</p>
<p>The coordinates of a typical point on the original curve in the (x, z)-plane are
</p>
<p>(b + r cos θ, r sin θ). When rotated about the z-axis the third coordinate remains
unchanged while the first two coordinates describe a circle of radius b + r cos θ
about the origin. This gives a parametrization f with formula
</p>
<p>f (θ, ψ) =
(
(b+ r cos θ) cosψ, (b+ r cos θ) sinψ, r sin θ
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>and domain (0, 2π)&times; (0, 2π). Hence
</p>
<p>fθ = (&minus;r sin θ cosψ,&minus;r sin θ sinψ, r cos θ)
</p>
<p>fψ =
(
&minus;(b+ r cos θ) sinψ, (b+ r cos θ) cosψ, 0

<p>11 Surface Area 127
</p>
<p>Example 11.2 We wish to find the surface area of the portion of the paraboloid
</p>
<p>z = 4 &minus; x2 &minus; y2 that lies above the xy-plane. This is the graph of the function
f (x, y) = 4 &minus; x2 &minus; y2 and we could find a parametrization using the method in
Example 10.3. We prefer, however, to take a more geometric approach.
</p>
<p>The standard paraboloid z = x2+y2 can be sketched by noting that cross-sections
parallel to the xy-plane are circles (Fig. 11.5a). This surface is turned upside down
</p>
<p>by taking z = &minus;x2 &minus; y2 and then moved up 4 units in the direction of the z-axis to
give us the original surface z = 4 &minus; x2 &minus; y2 (Fig. 11.5b).
</p>
<p>The surface cuts the xy-plane when 0 = z = 4 &minus; x2 &minus; y2, i.e. on the circle
x2 + y2 = 4. Clearly the geometry shows that we can project the surface in a
one-to-one fashion onto the disc x2 + y2 &le; 4 and if we reverse this we obtain the
parametrization
</p>
<p>(x, y) &isin; {x2 + y2 &lt; 4} &minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; (x, y, 4 &minus; x2 &minus; y2) &isin; Paraboloid.
</p>
<p>We could proceed directly to use this parametrization to compute the surface area.
</p>
<p>This would require a change of variable in working out the double integral. It is
</p>
<p>just as easy to initially use a more appropriate parametrization which avoids a later
</p>
<p>change of variable.
</p>
<p>We note that the domain of the above parametrization is a disc and the formula for
</p>
<p>the parametrization function involves x2 + y2. Either of these on their own suggest
polar or spherical coordinates. Since, however, the disc shape and x2+y2 only involve
the first two coordinates this inclines us towards polar coordinates for the pair (x, y).
</p>
<p>We use the parametrization
</p>
<p>f : (r, θ)&minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; (r cos θ, r sin θ, 4 &minus; r2), 0 &lt; r &lt; 2 and 0 &lt; θ &lt; 2π.
</p>
<p>We have fr = (cos θ, sin θ,&minus;2r), fθ = (&minus;r sin θ, r cos θ, 0). Hence E = 1 + 4r2,
G = r2 and since fr &middot; fθ = 0 we have F = 0. The surface area is

<p>128 11 Surface Area
</p>
<p>Example 11.3 We wish to find in this example the surface area of that portion of the
</p>
<p>sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 4z which lies outside the paraboloid x2 + y2 = 3z.
For this problem we first get some idea of the geometry and see, once this is
</p>
<p>reasonably clear, that the parametrization, the domain of the parametrization and
</p>
<p>even the integration are relatively straightforward.
</p>
<p>We have two surfaces, a sphere and a paraboloid. Rewriting the equation for the
</p>
<p>sphere by completing the square we get
</p>
<p>x2 + y2 + z2 &minus; 4z + 4 = 4
</p>
<p>i.e.
</p>
<p>x2 + y2 + (z &minus; 2)2 = 22
</p>
<p>and this is the sphere of radius 2 with centre (0, 0, 2) (Fig. 11.6).
</p>
<p>If we take the cross-section of the paraboloid corresponding to the plane z = c
we get a circle of radius
</p>
<p>&radic;
3c and so we can sketch the paraboloid (Fig. 11.7). The
</p>
<p>points of intersection of the two surfaces are identified by letting

</p>
<p>Fig. 11.8
</p>
<p>x2 + y2 + z2 &minus; 4z = 0 = x2 + y2 &minus; 3z.
</p>
<p>This implies z2 &minus; 4z = &minus;3z, i.e. z2 &minus; z = 0 and z = 1 or z = 0. When z = 0 we
get the point (0, 0, 0) on both surfaces and when z = 1 we get the curve x2 +y2 = 3,
i.e. a circle of radius
</p>
<p>&radic;
3. This usually indicates where one surface crosses over from
</p>
<p>the inside to the outside of the other and gives us the working diagram (Fig. 11.8).
</p>
<p>To find when the sphere is outside the paraboloid it suffices to compare the points
</p>
<p>(x, y, zp) and (x, y, zs) on the paraboloid and sphere, respectively, which project onto
</p>
<p>the same point (x, y, 0) in the (x, y)-plane. From the defining equations of the surfaces
</p>
<p>we have
</p>
<p>x2 + y2 = 4zs &minus; z2s = 3zp.
</p>
<p>Hence
</p>
<p>zs &minus; z2s = 3zp &minus; 3zs, i.e. zs(1 &minus; zs) = 3(zp &minus; zs).
</p>
<p>Since zs &ge; 0 we have zp &ge; zs if and only if 1&minus;zs &ge; 0, i.e. when 0 &le; zs &le; 1. Thus the
part of the sphere which lies outside the paraboloid is precisely that portion which
</p>
<p>lies between the parallel planes z = 0 and z = 1.
We thus have to find the surface area of the sphere x2+y2+(z&minus;2)2 = 22 between
</p>
<p>the planes z = 0 and z = 1. We use the formula for spherical polar coordinates
obtained in Example 10.5 translated so that the origin is at the point (0, 0, 2), i.e. let
</p>
<p>x = 2 sin θ cosψ, y = 2 sin θ sinψ, z &minus; 2 = 2 cos θ
</p>
<p>and it is now only necessary to find the domain of the parametrization. Since 0 &le;
z &le; 1 we consider &minus;2 &le; z &minus; 2 &le; &minus;1, i.e. &minus;2 &le; 2 cos θ &le; &minus;1. This implies (see
Fig. 10.14) 2π/3 &le; θ &le; π and, since there is no restriction on ψ , 0 &lt; ψ &lt; 2π .</p>

<p>Surface Integrals
</p>
<p>Summary We define the integral of a vector field over an oriented surface. Geomet-
</p>
<p>rical interpretations are discussed.
</p>
<p>Integrals are used to measure quantities such as length, area, expected value, etc., and
</p>
<p>as with all measurements, there has to be a unit of measurement. Our basic unit of
</p>
<p>measurement in integration theory over R is obtained by assigning the value 1 to the
</p>
<p>rectangle of height 1 over an interval of length 1 measured from left to right. From
</p>
<p>this we are able to define Riemann sums and afterwards the Riemann integral of a
</p>
<p>continuous function over a closed interval. The inclusion of &ldquo;left to right&rdquo; is crucial
</p>
<p>for without it we would have an ambiguous definition&mdash;and to a mathematician an
</p>
<p>ambiguous definition is no definition. To emphasis this point we call an interval [a, b]
directed from left to right a positive interval in R.
</p>
<p>Now supposeŴ is a curve in R2 and, for the sake of simplicity, we suppose thatŴ is
</p>
<p>not closed and that we are interested in defining the integral of a function over Ŵ. We
</p>
<p>have seen in Chap. 7 that we can define two integrals over Ŵ since Ŵ can be directed
</p>
<p>in two different ways and we have to decide, before doing any calculations, which
</p>
<p>interests us. We may think of a curve as having two sides&mdash;one for each direction of
</p>
<p>motion&mdash;like two escalators side by side, one going up and the other coming down
</p>
<p>(Fig. 12.1). We call one side positive and the other negative. If we are interested in
</p>
<p>evaluating integrals over {Ŵ, A, B} we call Ŵ directed from A to B the positive side.
We use a parametrization to transfer the integral over {Ŵ, A, B} to an integral
</p>
<p>over an interval in R which we subsequently evaluate. However, the parametrization
</p>
<p>must be directed correctly. This means that it must map a positive interval in R onto
</p>
<p>the positive side of Ŵ. Surface integrals are defined in the same way&mdash;just step up a
</p>
<p>dimension.
</p>
<p>Consider the unit sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 in R3. It has two sides&mdash;an inside and
an outside. More generally, the surface S which is the level set {X &isin; U : f (X) =
0 and &nabla; f (X) �= 0} has &plusmn;&nabla; f (X)
</p>
<p>/
</p>
<p>‖&nabla; f (X)‖ as unit normals at each point and we
may consider &nabla; f (X)
</p>
<p>/
</p>
<p>‖&nabla; f (X)‖ and &minus;&nabla; f (X)
/
</p>
<p>‖&nabla; f (X)‖ as lying on different sides.
We distinguish between the sides of a surface by using normals.

<p>Definition 12.1 An oriented surface in R3 is a pair (S,n) where S is a surface and
</p>
<p>n is a continuous mapping from S into R3 such that n(P) is a unit normal to the
</p>
<p>surface S at P .
</p>
<p>We will also use S to denote an oriented surface. The appearance of S signals that
</p>
<p>we have fixed an orientation on the underlying surface S. The notation S is simpler
</p>
<p>but if we need to specify the normal or if there is any possibility of confusion we
</p>
<p>write (S,n).
</p>
<p>Clearly if (S,n) is an oriented surface, then (S,&minus;n) is also an oriented surface and
the continuity requirement in the choice of normal implies that a connected surface
</p>
<p>can have at most two orientations. There exist, however, surfaces which do not
</p>
<p>admit any orientation and integration theory cannot be defined over such surfaces.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, every simple surface admits an orientation. If φ : U &sub; R2 &rarr; S is a
parametrization of S then
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>S, φx &times; φy
/
</p>
<p>‖φx &times; φy‖
)
</p>
<p>and
(
</p>
<p>S,&minus;φx &times; φy
/
</p>
<p>‖φx &times; φy‖
)
</p>
<p>are two oriented surfaces associated with S and if S is connected these are the only
</p>
<p>two oriented surfaces associated with S. Given an oriented surface (S,n) we call the
</p>
<p>side of S containing n the positive side and the side which contains &minus;n the negative
side. In the case of a simple oriented surface (S,n) a parametrization φ is said to be
</p>
<p>consistent with the orientation if
</p>
<p>φx &times; φy
‖φx &times; φy‖
</p>
<p>= n.
</p>
<p>If F is a continuous vector field on a simple oriented surface S we define
</p>
<p>&int;&int;
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>F
</p>
<p>by using a parametrization (φ,U ) consistent with the orientation and a process
</p>
<p>involving Riemann sums similar to that used to define surface area in the previous
</p>
<p>chapter (see Figs. 11.2 and 11.3 for reference). We find it convenient to use (u, v)
</p>
<p>for the variables in the domain of φ and (x, y, z) for the range, i.e. x = x(u, v),
y = y(u, v) and z = z(u, v). We begin by partitioning the domain U into small
rectangles and consider a typical rectangle R in this partition. Now, however, instead
</p>
<p>of taking the absolute area ofφ(R)we take the (signed) volume of the parallelepiped
</p>
<p>with base φ(R) and height determined by F (see Fig. 12.2).
</p>
<p>We use n as our positive unit of measurement perpendicular to the surface. This is
</p>
<p>reasonable since we are just considering a small portion of the surface φ(R), which</p>

the angle between F and n at φ(u, v) (see Fig. 12.3).
</p>
<p>We have already seen, in calculating surface area, that the area of φ(R), the base
</p>
<p>of the parallelepiped, is ‖φx &times; φy‖�x�y and hence the (signed) volume is

<p>(F &middot; n)‖φu &times; φv‖�u�v = (F &middot; φu &times; φv)�u�v.

<p>(F &middot; φu &times; φv)dudv.

<p>From this analysis we expect the volume of the solid one unit high on the positive

<p>side of the surface to equal the total surface area and to be obtained by integrating</p>

<p>the vector field n over S. Indeed, we have
</p>
<p>&int; &int;
</p>
<p>(S,n)
</p>
<p>n =
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>U
</p>
<p>(n &middot; n)‖φu &times; φv‖dudv = Surface area (S).
</p>
<p>It is now natural to define the surface integral of a scalar-valued function f on (S,n)
</p>
<p>by identifying f with f n, i.e.
</p>
<p>&int; &int;
</p>
<p>(S,n)
</p>
<p>f
def=
</p>
<p>&int; &int;
</p>
<p>(S,n)
</p>
<p>f n =
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>f
(
</p>
<p>φ(u, v)
)
</p>
<p>‖φu &times; φv‖dudv
</p>
<p>where φ is a parametrization consistent with the orientation. This is analogous to the
</p>
<p>way we defined, in Chap. 7, the integral of a scalar-valued function f along a curve
</p>
<p>by identifying f with f T . Although we needed an orientation to define this integral
</p>
<p>it is easily seen that &int; &int;
</p>
<p>(S,n)
</p>
<p>f =
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>(S,&minus;n)
</p>
<p>f
</p>
<p>and the value of the integral is independent of the orientation. This might suggest
</p>
<p>that it is possible to integrate a scalar-valued function over an arbitrary surface (see
</p>
<p>Definition 10.6). This is not true. What is required is an orientable surface, i.e.
</p>
<p>a surface which can be oriented. Simple surfaces are orientable. This means that
</p>
<p>we can use any parametrization to integrate a scalar-valued function over a simple
</p>
<p>surface.
</p>
<p>If the vector field F is represented by vectors emanating from the surface and if
</p>
<p>these all lie on the same side (of the surface) as n then the integral of F over (S,n) is
</p>
<p>non-negative. On the right-hand diagram in Fig. 12.2 we see that {φu, φv,n} follows
the right-hand rule and note that F and n lie on the same side of (S,n) if and only
</p>
<p>if the angle between them lies in [&minus;π/2, π/2].
</p>
<p>Example 12.2 We evaluate
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>(S,n)
</p>
<p>F where S is the sphere of radius r with centre at
</p>
<p>the origin oriented outwards and F(x, y, z) = (x, y, z). Although a sphere is not
a simple surface we can treat it as one for integration theory (see our remarks in
</p>
<p>the previous chapter). Here, however, we do not need any parametrization. The unit
</p>
<p>normals at a point P on S are &plusmn;P/‖P‖ and since S is oriented outwards
</p>
<p>n(P) =
P
</p>
<p>‖P‖
=
</p>
<p>P

<p>(x, y, z &minus; a)
&radic;
</p>
<p>2az &minus; z2
</p>
<p>where S is the part of the surface x2 + y2 + (z &minus; a)2 = a2 which lies inside the
cylinder x2 + y2 = ay and underneath the plane z = a oriented with outward
pointing normal.
</p>
<p>We first sketch the surface over which we are integrating. Initially this appears as
</p>
<p>a rather formidable task but by sketching each part separately (Fig. 12.4) and then
</p>
<p>combining (Fig. 12.5) them it becomes relatively simple. The surface x2 + y2 + (z&minus;
a)2 = a2 is a sphere of radius a with centre (0, 0, a). The equation x2 + y2 = ay
can be rewritten as
</p>
<p>x2 + y2 &minus; ay +
a2

and a units above it. The outward normal to the sphere of radius a with centre (0, 0, a)

<p>Fig. 12.5
</p>
<p>From Fig. 12.5 we observe that our integral is over part of the lower right-hand
</p>
<p>quarter of the sphere. We use geographical coordinates about the point (0, 0, a)
</p>
<p>F : (θ,ψ)&minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; (a cos θ cosψ, a cos θ sinψ, a + a sin θ).
</p>
<p>Since θ refers to latitude and we are considering the lower portion we have
</p>
<p>&minus;π/2 &lt; θ &lt; 0. From the sketch y &gt; 0 and hence sinψ &gt; 0, i.e. 0 &lt; ψ &lt; π ,
and since the surface lies inside the cylinder we also have x2 + y2 &lt; ay, i.e.
a2 cos2 θ &lt; a2 cos θ sinψ. Hence cos θ &lt; sinψ = cos(ψ &minus; π
</p>
<p>2
). By considering
</p>
<p>separately the cases 0 &lt; ψ &lt; π

<p>and π

&lt; ψ &lt; π we obtain π

<p>Now
</p>
<p>2az &minus; z2 = &minus;a2 + 2az &minus; z2 + a2 = a2 &minus; (a &minus; z)2
</p>
<p>and changing this into our new coordinates we get
</p>
<p>&radic;
</p>
<p>2az &minus; z2 = (a2 &minus; a2 sin2 θ)1/2 = (a2 cos2 θ)1/2 = a cos θ.

<p>parameterizations to transfer integration from an oriented surface in R3 to integra-
</p>
<p>tion over subsets of the coordinate planes in R3, i.e. the xy-plane, the yz-plane and
</p>
<p>the xz-plane. Each of these planes is a surface in R3 and to define our integral we must
</p>
<p>assign a positive side to each of these planes for the same reason that we required
</p>
<p>positive intervals in R.
</p>
<p>We first define the positive unit vectors in the x , y and z directions in R3 as
</p>
<p>(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1). These choices are natural in view of the way we
</p>
<p>sketch graphs in R2 and R3. Consider now the xy-plane in R3 as the surface defined
</p>
<p>by f &minus;1(0) where f (x, y, z) = z. The unit normals to this surface are &plusmn;(0, 0, 1) and
we must choose between them to define a positive side to the xy-plane. We use the
</p>
<p>positive unit vectors in the x and y directions in that order and the right-hand rule
</p>
<p>or cross product to define the positive side of the xy-plane as that oriented by the
</p>
<p>normal
</p>
<p>(1, 0, 0)&times; (0, 1, 0) = (0, 0, 1).
</p>
<p>We denote the positively oriented xy-plane in R3 by R2
(x,y). Similarly the positive
</p>
<p>side of the yz-plane is defined by the normal (0, 1, 0) &times; (0, 0, 1) = (1, 0, 0)
and denoted by R2
</p>
<p>(y,z) and the positive side of the zx-plane is defined by (0, 0, 1)&times;
(1, 0, 0) = (0, 1, 0) and denoted by R2
</p>
<p>(z,x).
</p>
<p>In Fig. 12.6 we see the direction of rotation (i.e. rotation to the left) used
</p>
<p>to measure angles in each of the coordinate planes and also the direction of a closed
</p>
<p>anticlockwise oriented curve.
</p>
<p>If we look at each individual coordinate plane we get, using Fig. 12.6, the diagrams
</p>
<p>in Fig. 12.7 showing the anticlockwise directions.

S. Let

(

<p>( f, 0, 0),

</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>(0, g, 0) and
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>(0, 0, h).
</p>
<p>First observe that ( f, 0, 0) is parallel to the x-axis and may be represented as in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.8, where we have rotated the axes but preserved the orientation.
</p>
<p>Since f points in the direction of the normal (1, 0, 0) to R2
(y,z) it is natural to
</p>
<p>project onto R2
(y,z) and to define

<p>Partition U into rectangles, (Ri j )i j . We consider the &ldquo;boundary&rdquo; of Py,z(Ri j ) as a
</p>
<p>directed curve in R2
(y,z) &ldquo;parameterized&rdquo; by Py,z restricted to the boundary of the
</p>
<p>anticlockwise oriented rectangle Ri j in the uv-plane. Hence Py,z(Ri j ) will have
</p>
<p>positive (or at least non-negative) area if it is oriented in an anticlockwise fashion in

<p>Formula (12.3) is our original definition of the integral of F over S and thus (12.2)

<p>and (12.4) are new expressions for
&int;&int;
</p>

<p>F. We have also shown, provided we use the

</p>
<p>In certain cases these projections map S onto geometrically nice domains in the

<p>coordinate planes and this may lead to simpler calculations -see for instance our next
</p>
<p>example, Example 13.2 and Exercises 12.1, 12.2 and 12.8.

</p>
<p>We have established five formulae for calculating surface integrals. Furthermore,
</p>
<p>our excursion into oriented planes has led to geometric insights on the construction of
</p>
<p>the integral and to a method of evaluating integrals by projecting onto the coordinate
</p>
<p>planes. There are still a number of topics to be sorted out, e.g. independence of the
</p>
<p>parametrization, and we discuss these in examples as we proceed.
</p>
<p>Example 12.4 In this simple example we use projections to calculate the area of the
</p>
<p>triangle with vertices (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1). The fact that we can easily find
</p>
<p>the answer independently allows us to check our solution.

<p>Stokes&rsquo; Theorem
</p>
<p>Summary We discuss Stokes&rsquo; theorem for oriented surfaces in R3.
</p>
<p>Stokes&rsquo; theorem, the fundamental theorem of calculus for surfaces, generalises
</p>
<p>Green&rsquo;s theorem to oriented surfaces S = (S,n) with edge or boundary Ŵ (the
term edge avoids confusion with our other use of the word boundary) consisting of
</p>
<p>a finite number of piecewise smooth directed curves. We suppose that the positive
</p>
<p>side of S lies on the left-hand side as we move along Ŵ in the positive direction. In
</p>
<p>practice this consistency between the orientations of the surface and its edge may be
</p>
<p>verified by sketching. In certain cases the normal n admits a continuous extension to
</p>
<p>the boundary and a parametrization P of the boundary has the correct orientation if
</p>
<p>at one point, say P(t0), we have P
&prime;(t0) &middot;n
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>P(t0)
)
&gt; 0 where n
</p>
<p>(
P(t0)
</p>
<p>)
is the value of
</p>
<p>the extension of n at P(t0). If a consistent parametrization of the surface extends to
</p>
<p>give a parametrization of the boundary then the boundary is also correctly directed
</p>
<p>(see Example 13.5).
</p>
<p>Theorem 13.1 (Stokes&rsquo; Theorem) Let S = (S,n) denote an oriented surface in R3
with boundary Ŵ consisting of a finite number of piecewise smooth directed curves.
</p>
<p>We suppose that the positive side of S lies on the left of the positive side of Ŵ. If F is
</p>
<p>a smooth vector field on S &cup; Ŵ then
&int;
</p>
<p>Ŵ
</p>
<p>F =
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>curl(F) (13.1)
</p>
<p>i.e.
&int;
</p>
<p>Ŵ
</p>
<p>〈F, T 〉ds =
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>〈curl(F),n〉d A
</p>
<p>where T is the unit tangent to the directed curves Ŵ.
</p>
<p>The proof, which we omit, is obtained by applying Green&rsquo;s theorem to the pro-
</p>
<p>jections onto the coordinate planes. In Chaps. 6 and 12 we developed techniques
</p>
<p>to evaluate the left- and right-hand sides of (13.1), respectively. Thus the only new

</p>
<p>3, 0 &lt; θ &lt; 2π.

<p>We have φr = (cos θ, sin θ, 0) and φθ = (&minus;r sin θ, r cos θ, 0). Hence

<p>Since

<p>our parametrization is consistent with the positive orientation of R2

<p>Moral A reasonable sketch is not just optional but necessary. The form of F, i.e.
</p>
<p>the fact that the first two coordinates were zero, combined with information on how
</p>
<p>surface integrals can be projected onto the coordinate planes greatly simplified the
</p>
<p>calculations required.
</p>
<p>Example 13.3 We evaluate

<p>&int;&int;

<p>S
</p>
<p>curl(F) where
</p>
<p>F(x, y, z) = (y2 cos xz, x3eyz,&minus;e&minus;xyz)
</p>
<p>and S is the portion of the sphere x2 + y2 + (z &minus; 2)2 = 8 which lies above the
xy-plane oriented outwards. The edge or boundary of S, Ŵ, is where the sphere cuts
</p>
<p>the xy-plane, i.e. where z = 0. We have x2+ y2+4 = 8, i.e. x2+ y2 = 4 (Fig. 13.2).
Since the positive side of the sphere is the outside we see from Fig. 13.2 that
</p>
<p>the surface S is on the left as we move along Ŵ in an anticlockwise direction in the
</p>
<p>xy-plane. This gives us our direction along Ŵ. By Stokes&rsquo; theorem
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>Ŵ
</p>
<p>F =
&int;&int;

<p>S

<p>Example 13.4 We wish to use Stokes&rsquo; theorem to find a suitable orientation of the

<p>The curve Ŵ is the intersection of a sphere and a plane through the centre of the

<p>The curve Ŵ is the edge or boundary of the two hemispheres on either side of it

<p>Moral The curl of a vector field is a form of derivative. If the entries are linear, as
</p>
<p>in this example, the curl is constant. If the entries are of degree 2 then the curl has
</p>
<p>linear entries.

planes z = 0 and z = 2π by using the vector field

</p>
<p>We first examine the surface z = tan&minus;1(y/x). This can be parametrized as a graph

</p>
<p>What sort of surface is this? Well, if we fix different values of r and let θ vary
</p>
<p>we obtain a helix (see Example 5.2). In Fig. 13.4 we have sketched the surface for
</p>
<p>1/2 &le; r &le; 1. We are considering the portion of the surface in Fig. 13.4, extended</p>

<p>over all r , which lies inside the cone and between the two planes. It is thus a screw-
</p>
<p>shaped surface or spiral staircase with the spirals or steps getting wider as we rise.
</p>
<p>The fact that the surface lies between the planes z = 0 and z = π means that we
have just one full twist of the screw or one turn of the staircase (Fig. 13.5).
</p>
<p>We can use the parametrization (13.2) but the restriction caused by lying inside
</p>
<p>the other surfaces means that we must restrict the range. Translating the boundaries
</p>
<p>into polar coordinates, we get
</p>
<p>x2 + y2 = r2 cos2 θ + r2 sin2 θ = r2 = z2
</p>
<p>and since 0 &le; z &le; 2π this implies r = z, 0 &le; r &le; 2π . Hence our parametrization
of the surface is

<p>on the boundary of U . We can also look at it geometrically by examining where the
</p>
<p>boundary curves intersect S. We first look at the curve of intersection of the cone
</p>
<p>and the screw. The cone is parametrized (Examples 10.4 and 10.5) by
</p>
<p>(r, θ)&minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; (r cos θ, r sin θ, θ)
</p>
<p>and comparing this with (13.3) we get a curve of intersection Ŵ1 when r = θ . This
curve is parametrized by
</p>
<p>θ &minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; (θ cos θ, θ sin θ, θ), 0 &le; θ &le; 2π.
</p>
<p>The curve Ŵ1 joins the origin to P1 = (2π, 0, 2π). The second curve Ŵ2 is obtained
by putting θ = 2π and from (13.3) this is parametrized by
</p>
<p>r &minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; (r cos 2π, r sin 2π, 2π) = (r, 0, 2π)
</p>
<p>where 0 &lt; r &lt; 2π . This is the straight line joining P1 to (0, 0, 2π). From Fig. 13.6
</p>
<p>it runs in the negative direction and so we must reverse the orientation.
</p>
<p>The third curve Ŵ3 is obtained by letting r = 0 in (13.3) and we have a parame-
trization
</p>
<p>θ &minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; (0, 0, θ), 0 &le; θ &le; 2π.
</p>
<p>Ŵ3 joins (0, 0, 2π) to the origin and Ŵ = Ŵ1 &cup;Ŵ2 &cup;Ŵ3 is a closed piecewise smooth
directed curve (Fig. 13.7).
</p>
<p>We have oriented the surface and directed its boundary. Are these consistent in
</p>
<p>order to apply Stokes&rsquo; theorem? Yes, because the parametrization f of Ŵ is obtained
</p>
<p>from a continuous extension of a consistent parametrization of the surface. You have

<p>Triple Integrals
</p>
<p>Summary We define triple integrals of scalar-valued functions over open subsets of

<p>R
3, discuss coordinate systems in R3, justify a change of variable formula and use
</p>
<p>Fubini&rsquo;s theorem to evaluate integrals.
</p>
<p>Let f be a real-valued function defined on an open subsetU of R3. By using partitions
</p>
<p>of the coordinate axes to draw planes parallel to the coordinate planes (Fig. 14.1) we
</p>
<p>obtain a grid which partitions R3 into cubes. Let (x i , y j , zk) denote a typical point
</p>
<p>in the cube [xi , xi+1]&times; [y j , y j+1]&times; [zk, zk+1]. The Riemann sum of f with respect
to this grid
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>j
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>k
</p>
<p>f (x i , y j , zk)(xi+1 &minus; xi ) (y j+1 &minus; y j ) (zk+1 &minus; zk)
</p>
<p>is formed by summing over all cubes that lie in U . If the Riemann sums converge,
</p>
<p>as we take finer and finer partitions and grids, to a limit then f is said to be Riemann
</p>
<p>integrable and the limit &int;&int;&int;
</p>
<p>U
</p>
<p>f (x, y, z) dxdydz
</p>
<p>is called the (Riemann) integral of f over U .
</p>
<p>IfU is a bounded open subset of R3 with smooth boundary and f is the restriction
</p>
<p>toU of a continuous function f onU then f is integrable overU . This result, proved
</p>
<p>using uniform continuity of f on the compact subset U of R3, implies the existence
</p>
<p>of an abundance of integrable functions.
</p>
<p>If f (x, y, z) &equiv; 1 the Riemann sum is the volume of all cubes inside U and in the
limit equals the volume of U , Vol(U ). Thus
</p>
<p>Vol(U ) =

</p>
<p>In evaluating triple integrals we use an extension ofFubini&rsquo;s theorem. This is obtained
</p>
<p>from the Riemann sum by first summing over i , taking a limit, then summing over j
</p>
<p>and taking a limit and finally summing over k and taking a limit. To justify this process
</p>
<p>it is usual to assume that the domain of integration has a &ldquo;box-like&rdquo; appearance, i.e.
</p>
<p>it is bounded above and below by surfaces z = f1(x, y) and z = f2(x, y), front and
rear by surfaces x = g1(y, z) and x = g2(y, z) and on the left and right by surfaces
y = h1(x, z) and y = h2(x, z). The situations we discuss are of this type but by no
means reflect the full range of examples to which Fubini&rsquo;s theorem applies. Many
</p>
<p>open sets can be partitioned into a finite union of sets and Fubini&rsquo;s theorem applies
</p>
<p>to each of these. We refer to our remarks on Green&rsquo;s theorem in Chap. 9 for further
</p>
<p>details.
</p>
<p>To apply Fubini&rsquo;s theorem we must examine various cross-sections of the domain
</p>
<p>of integration U . First suppose that the set of non-empty cross-sections of U parallel
</p>
<p>to the xy-plane, i.e. those obtained by fixing the z-coordinate, determine an interval
</p>
<p>(a, b) on the z-axis (Fig. 14.2).
</p>
<p>Let A(z) denote the cross-section defined by fixing z in (a, b), i.e.
</p>
<p>A(z) = {(x, y) &isin; R2(x,y) : (x, y, z) &isin; U }.</p>

</p>
<p>and we now have to evaluate the inner integral of two variables. In some cases it
</p>
<p>is possible to do this directly, see for instance Example 14.1, but usually we apply
</p>
<p>the two-variable Fubini&rsquo;s theorem to each A(z). For this we assume that the region
</p>
<p>A(z) &sub; R2
(x,y) is bounded on the left and right by the graphs of functions of y over
</p>
<p>some interval (Fig. 14.3). Both the functions and the interval will depend on z and
</p>
<p>we denote the interval by
(
</p>
<p>c(z), d(z)
)
</p>
<p>and the functions on the left and right by
</p>
<p>y &rarr; l(y, z) and y &rarr; r(y, z) respectively.
This implies
</p>
<p>&int;&int;
</p>
<p>A(z)
</p>
<p>f (x, y, z) dxdy =
d(z)
&int;

<p>and

</p>

</p>
<p>Thus to evaluate triple integrals it is necessary to identify, by sketching, cross-sections
</p>
<p>of the open set U . Once this has been achieved and the result compared with the
</p>
<p>abstract figures above it is a matter of writing down the iterated integrals and evalu-
</p>
<p>ating them using one-variable integration theory. We have, as in the two-dimensional
</p>
<p>case a choice in the order of integration&mdash;in fact a total of 3! = 6 choices, some may
be easy, others difficult and some impossible. There are no definite rules.</p>

<p>Example 14.1 Let B denote the solid ball of radius r with centre at the origin, i.e.

<p>B = {(x, y, z) : x2 + y2 + z2 &lt; r2}. We calculate the volume of B by integrating
the function f &equiv; 1 over B. Figure 14.4a shows clearly that the values of z which
give non-zero cross-sections lie in the interval (&minus;r, r) and the cross-section for fixed
z is the disc x2 + y2 &le; r2 &minus; z2 (Fig. 14.4b).

<p>The geometry of the previous example was reasonably straightforward. Many
</p>
<p>examples appear initially to involve a rather complicated geometric shape. However,
</p>
<p>we are usually dealing with a limited number of objects, mainly conic sections,
</p>
<p>mixed together and once familiarity with these has been established and sufficiently
</p>
<p>many cross-sections sketched&mdash;with the help of the defining inequalities&mdash;the correct
</p>
<p>approach often presents itself.
</p>
<p>Example 14.2 We wish to find the volume of the region V lying below the plane
</p>
<p>z = 3&minus; 2y and above the paraboloid z = x2 + y2, i.e. the set {(x, y, z) : x2 + y2 &lt;
z &lt; 3 &minus; 2y}. We begin by considering a full sketch (Fig. 14.5).
</p>
<p>The coordinates of P and Q are found by solving between the equations z =
x2 + y2 and z = 3&minus; 2y. These imply x2 + y2 = 3&minus; 2y, i.e. x2 + y2 + 2y+ 1 = 4.
Hence x2 + (y + 1)2 = 22. The extreme values of y are obtained by letting x = 0.
This gives (y + 1)2 = 22, i.e. y + 1 = &plusmn;2. Hence y = &minus;3 or +1. The coordinates
of P and Q are (0,&minus;3, 9) and (0, 1, 1) respectively. Hence &minus;3 &le; y &le; +1. From</p>

<p>We choose to take y as the final variable in our order of integration since it is clear
</p>
<p>from Fig. 14.5 that all cross-sections parallel to the xz-plane are of the same type
</p>
<p>whereas cross-sections parallel to the xy-plane, i.e. fixing z, are different for z &lt; 1
</p>
<p>and z &ge; 1. A different order of integration can be used as a second opinion.
From the two previous examples we see that the evaluation of triple integrals
</p>
<p>proceeded in three stages. First we chose an order of integration and next examined the
</p>
<p>geometry of the domain of integration in order to determine the limits of integration
</p>
<p>in the inner integrals. Finally we evaluated a sequence of one variable integrals. The
</p>
<p>alternatives at each stage in the process point towards a useful technique commonly
</p>
<p>called change of variable. In place of a detailed motivation we briefly mention three
</p>
<p>pertinent ideas.
</p>
<p>(a) The domain of integrationU was partitioned into cubes, Fig. 14.7a, with element
</p>
<p>of volume �V easily calculated using �x &times;�y &times;�z. We could use instead a
grid based on spheres centred at the origin and planes through the origin to obtain
</p>
<p>a different element of volume, Fig. 14.7b, or a grid based on cylinders parallel
</p>
<p>to the z-axis and planes perpendicular and parallel to the z-axis (Fig. 14.7c).</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>168 14 Triple Integrals
</p>
<p>(a) (b) (c)
</p>
<p>Fig. 14.7
</p>
<p>These alternatives lead to more complicated formulae for �V but hopefully
</p>
<p>the new limits of integration and the resulting one-variable integrals are less
</p>
<p>complicated.
</p>
<p>(b) We used Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) to denote a typical point in the domain
</p>
<p>of integration U but we may consider other methods of identifying points in U .
</p>
<p>For instance, if U is the solid sphere of radius 1 then each point in U lies in a
</p>
<p>sphere of radius r , 0 &le; r &le; 1, and using the parametrization of the sphere of
radius r given in Example 10.5 we can identify points of U by means of r (the
</p>
<p>distance to the origin), θ the angle of latitude and ψ (the angle of longitude).
</p>
<p>In terms of the coordinates (r, θ, ψ) the domain U becomes the parallelepiped
</p>
<p>(0, 1)&times; (&minus;π/2, π/2)&times; (0, 2π) and, as previously noted, integration in this case
is much more pleasant. The new set of coordinates gives a correspondence F
</p>
<p>between a domain in R3
(r,θ,ψ) and the original domain U in R
</p>
<p>3
(x,y,z) (Fig. 14.8).
</p>
<p>By Example 10.5, F(r, θ, ψ) = (r cos θ cosψ, r cos θ sinψ, r sin θ). The idea
now is to transfer the cubical grid on U , using F , to a grid, which is usually
</p>
<p>not cubical, on F(U ) and hence to evaluate the integral. In carrying out this
</p>
<p>operation it will be necessary to calculate
</p>
<p>Vol (F(�V )) = Vol (F(�r &times;�θ &times;�ψ))

<p>14 Triple Integrals 169
</p>
<p>and this is the problem that also arises in (a). The mapping F has many of the
</p>
<p>features that we have previously associated with a parametrization and, by now,
</p>
<p>the following definition should appear natural.
</p>
<p>Definition 14.3 A parametrization of an open set V in Rn is a bijective differentiable
</p>
<p>mapping F from an open subset U of Rn onto V such that F &prime;(X) is an invertible
linear operator for all X in U .
</p>
<p>This definition contains the essential properties that we used to parametrize curves
</p>
<p>and surfaces and may also be regarded as a method of providing V with a new
</p>
<p>coordinate system. The requirement that F &prime;(X) be invertible (or equivalently that
det
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>F &prime;(X)
)
</p>
<p>
= 0) is the three-dimensional analogue of the condition P &prime;(t) 
= 0 for
curves and φx &times; φy 
= 0 for surfaces.
</p>
<p>(c) A third, perhaps more obscure, approach is motivated by the substitutions that
</p>
<p>may arise in the one-variable integrals in the final stage. In Example 14.2 we
</p>
<p>needed one such change. Working backwards it may be possible to choose ini-
</p>
<p>tially a coordinate system which does not require a change of variable in the
</p>
<p>iterated integrals.
</p>
<p>We return now to (b) above to work out the formula for the change of variable.
</p>
<p>Let U denote an open subset of R3
(r,s,t) and let g : U &rarr; g(U ) = V denote a
</p>
<p>parametrization of the open subset V of R3
(u,v,w). Note that g
</p>
<p>&minus;1 is a parametrization
</p>
<p>ofU . To avoid confusion we think of U and V as lying in different copies of R3 each
</p>
<p>with their own set of coordinates, (r, s, t) and (u, v,w) respectively. This explains
</p>
<p>the terminology &ldquo;change of variables&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Let f denote an integrable function on g(U ) (Fig. 14.9). Take a cubical grid on
</p>
<p>U , transfer it by g to a grid on g(U ) and then form a Riemann sum of f . A typical
</p>
<p>term in this Riemann sum is

<p>Now g(�ri&times;�s j&times;�tk) is approximately a parallelepiped with sides gr�r, gs�s
and gt�t . We have already discussed the volumes of parallelepipeds while intro-
</p>
<p>ducing Stokes&rsquo; theorem in Chap. 12. The area of the base of the parallelepiped is
</p>
<p>‖gr &times; gs�ri &middot;�s j‖ (Fig. 14.10a) where the partial derivatives of g are evaluated at
</p>
<p>(r i , s j , tk). The height of the parallelepiped is the length of the projection of gt�tk
onto a direction perpendicular to the base. Since gr &times; gs is perpendicular to the base
</p>
<p>the required height is
(
</p>
<p>gr &times; gs &middot; gt
/
</p>
<p>‖gr &times; gs‖
)

V &times;(0, 1) in R3. A function f : V &rarr; R is integrable over V if and only if f̃ , defined
by f̃ (x, y, z) = f (x, y), is integrable over Ṽ and, moreover,

</p>
<p>If g : U &sub; R2
(r,s) &rarr; V &sub; R

<p>2
(u,v) is a mapping between the open sets U and V then
</p>
<p>it is easily seen that g is a parametrization of V if and only if g̃ : Ũ &sub; R3
(r,s,t) &minus;&rarr;
</p>
<p>Ṽ &sub; R3
(u,v.w), defined by g̃(r, s, t) = (g(r, s), t), is a parametrization of Ṽ . Since

</p>
<p>we have det(g&prime;) = det(g̃&prime;) and

</p>
<p>Fig. 14.11
</p>
<p>If S is a simple oriented surface in R3 and (g1,U1) and (g2,U2) are parametriza-
</p>
<p>tions of S consistent with the orientation then the bijectivity and smoothness of g1
and g2 imply that the mapping g
</p>
<p>&minus;1
2 ◦ g1 is a parametrization of U2 (Fig. 14.11).
</p>
<p>The change of variables formula for double integrals may now be used to show
</p>
<p>that integrals over S are independent of the parametrization and justifies the notation
</p>
<p>used in earlier chapters (we remark that g1 and g2 map onto the same side of S if and
</p>
<p>only if det
(
</p>
<p>(g&minus;12 ◦ g1)
&prime;
)
</p>
<p>is always strictly positive).
</p>
<p>We have noted above how a solid sphere is a union of surfaces, i.e.
</p>
<p>{(x, y, z) : x2 + y2 + z2 &lt; r2} =
⋃
</p>
<p>0&le;s&lt;r
{(x, y, z) : x2 + y2 + z2 = s2}
</p>
<p>and using parametrization of surfaces we were able to fill in to obtain a parame-
</p>
<p>trization of the solid sphere. In fact, we do not quite get a parametrization of the full
</p>
<p>solid, since to obtain a bijective mapping, we are forced to miss a small portion of the
</p>
<p>sphere. This is the same problem that we encountered and discussed fully in parame-
</p>
<p>trizing the classical surfaces (Chap. 10). We do not enter into a full discussion here
</p>
<p>but remark that after a similar discussion we would arrive at an analogous conclusion
</p>
<p>for solids. The portion of the solid omitted has volume zero and so for integration
</p>
<p>purposes we may treat the mappings in the following example as parametrizations
</p>
<p>of the full solid.
</p>
<p>Example 14.4 The procedure outlined above for the sphere can be applied to a
</p>
<p>number of solids and using Table 11.1 we obtain the following parametrizations.

<p>Example 14.5 In this example we calculate the volume of a solid torus. We discussed
</p>
<p>the boundary surface of a torus in Example 11.1 and obtained the parametrization
</p>
<p>f (θ, ψ) = ((b + r cos θ) cosψ, (b + r cos θ) sinψ, r sin θ)
</p>
<p>where 0 &lt; θ &lt; 2π , 0 &lt; ψ &lt; 2π (Fig. 11.4). We generate the solid torus by rotating

<p>the disc and obtain the parametrization

(θ, ψ, s)&minus;&minus;&minus;&rarr; ((b + s cos θ) cosψ, (b + s cos θ) sinψ, s sin θ) .
</p>
<p>We will use the change of variable formula to calculate the volume but first note how
</p>
<p>the following geometric observation immediately gives the answer. The solid torus
</p>
<p>is obtained by rotating a disc of radius r with centre on the y-axis at a distance b</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-6419-7_11">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-6419-7_11</a></div>

</p>
<p>from the origin about the z-axis. Thus the disc is rotated through a distance 2πb and
</p>
<p>generates a solid whose volume is
</p>
<p>πr2 &middot; 2πb = 2π2r2b.
</p>
<p>By the change of variable formula
</p>
<p>Volume (Torus) =

<p>∣

<p>∣det
(
</p>
<p>F &prime;(θ, ψ, s)
)∣
</p>
<p>∣ dθdψds.
</p>
<p>From Table 11.1 we obtain, on replacing r by s, the first two columns of F &prime;; Fθ = fθ
and Fψ = fψ . Hence
</p>
<p>F &prime;(θ, ψ, s) =
</p>
<p>⎛
</p>
<p>⎝
</p>
<p>&minus;s sin θ cosψ &minus;(b + s cos θ) sinψ cos θ cosψ
&minus;s sin θ sinψ (b + s cos θ) cosψ cos θ sinψ
</p>
<p>s cos θ 0 sin θ
</p>
<p>⎞
</p>
<p>⎠ .
</p>
<p>From the matrix representation it is easily seen that Fθ , Fψ and Fs , i.e. the columns
</p>
<p>of F &prime;, are mutually perpendicular vectors and hence generate a parallelepiped shaped
like a rectangular box. In this case the volume is the product of the lengths of the sides.
</p>
<p>A further application of Table 11.1 gives us ‖Fθ‖ = ‖ fθ‖ =
&radic;
E = s and ‖Fψ‖ =
</p>
<p>‖ fψ‖ =
&radic;
G = b + s cos θ. Since ‖Fs‖ = (cos2 θ cos2 ψ + cos2 θ sin2 ψ +

<p>sin2 θ)1/2 = 1 we have

<p>Example 14.6 To find the volume of the solid contained within the sphere x2 + y2 +
z2 = 4a2 and the cylinder x2 + (y &minus; a)2 = a2. In Example 12.3 we considered a
geometric situation similar to the present one. By not moving the origin we adopt
</p>
<p>here a slightly different approach. From Fig. 14.12 we see that the solid lies above
</p>
<p>and below the plane disc x2 + (y &minus; a)2 &le; a2 and this immediately suggests polar
coordinates.

<p>The Divergence Theorem
</p>
<p>Summary We state, discuss and give examples of the divergence theorem of Gauss.
</p>
<p>The divergence theorem of Gauss is an extension to R3 of the fundamental theorem
</p>
<p>of calculus and of Green&rsquo;s theorem and is a close relative, but not a direct descendent,
</p>
<p>of Stokes&rsquo; theorem. This theorem allows us to evaluate the integral of a scalar-valued
</p>
<p>function over an open subset of R3 by calculating the surface integral of a certain
</p>
<p>vector field over its boundary.
</p>
<p>In Chap. 6 we defined the divergence of the vector field F = ( f1, f2, f3) as
</p>
<p>div(F) = &nabla; &middot; F =
(
</p>
<p>&part;
</p>
<p>&part;x
,
&part;
</p>
<p>&part;y
,
&part;
</p>
<p>&part;z
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>&middot; ( f1, f2, f3) =

<p>&part; f2
</p>
<p>&part;y

</p>
<p>&part; f3
</p>
<p>&part;z
</p>
<p>and we have previously written symbolically
</p>
<p>curl(F) = &nabla; &times; F.
</p>
<p>Carrying this symbolism a step further we now write
</p>
<p>div(curl F) = &nabla; &middot; &nabla; &times; F =

<p>This suggests, since the determinant of a matrix with two identical rows is zero, that
</p>
<p>div(curl F) = 0 for any smooth vector field F. This is indeed true. Symbolism, how-
ever, does not prove anything and it is necessary to verify this formally. At the same
</p>
<p>time it is a good example of the role of symbolism (and notation) in mathematics&mdash;
</p>
<p>it can be suggestive&mdash;and sometimes leads to true results that might otherwise be
</p>
<p>overlooked.

<p>180 15 The Divergence Theorem
</p>
<p>If F is the velocity of a gas then div(F) represents the rate of expansion (or com-
</p>
<p>pression) per unit volume. The divergence theorem states that the total expansion
</p>
<p>(or contraction) over a regionU equals the total inflow (or outflow) across the bound-
</p>
<p>ary. Very little physical intuition is required in order to accept this as reasonable. This
</p>
<p>physical interpretation is responsible for the terminology &ldquo;divergence&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>We now formally state the divergence theorem.
</p>
<p>Theorem 15.1 (Gauss&rsquo; Divergence Theorem) Suppose S is an oriented surface in
</p>
<p>R
3, with outward pointing normal, enclosing an open set U and F is a smooth vector
</p>
<p>field on U (= U &cup; S) then
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>F =
&int;&int;&int;
</p>
<p>U
</p>
<p>div(F).
</p>
<p>An initial proof uses Green&rsquo;s theorem and Fubini&rsquo;s theorem on cross-sections of
</p>
<p>U and, as noted in earlier chapters, this places certain geometrical restrictions on
</p>
<p>U and S. From the previous chapter we see that it suffices to have U bounded, top
</p>
<p>and bottom, above and below, front and back by graphs of functions which form the
</p>
<p>boundary S. This covers many examples involving classical Euclidean shapes.
</p>
<p>Further examples, for instance the annulus 0 &lt; r1 &lt; x
2 + y2 + z2 &lt; r2 &lt; &infin;,
</p>
<p>are obtained by dividing the open set into a finite number of sets on each of which
</p>
<p>the initial proof applies (we refer to our discussion on Green&rsquo;s theorem in Chap. 9
</p>
<p>for further details). In general, the boundary will be composed of a finite number of
</p>
<p>distinct simple surfaces.
</p>
<p>The collection of sets to which the divergence theorem applies is quite large but
</p>
<p>difficult to formulate precisely without recourse to further concepts from differential
</p>
<p>geometry. For this reason we have carefully avoided proving the theorem and giving
</p>
<p>detailed hypotheses on U and S in the statement of the theorem. The theorem, as
</p>
<p>stated, is sufficient for the examples we consider.
</p>
<p>Example 15.2 In this example we use the divergence theorem to evaluate
</p>
<p>&int;&int;&int;
</p>
<p>V
</p>
<p>div(F)dxdydz
</p>
<p>where V is the solid cylinder {(x, y, z) : x2 + y2 &lt; 1, 0 &lt; z &lt; 1} and
</p>
<p>F(x, y, z) =
(
</p>
<p>1 &minus; (x2 + y2)3, 1 &minus; (x2 + y2)3, x2z2
)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>The boundary of V is composed of the cylinder {(x, y, z) : x2+ y2 = 1, 0 &lt; z &lt; 1}
and the flat discs {(x, y, z) : x2+y2 &le; 1, z = 0} and {(x, y, z) : x2+y2 &le; 1, z = 1}
(Fig. 15.1).
</p>
<p>The outward normal on the curved surface at the point (x, y, z) is (x, y, 0). On the
</p>
<p>upper and lower discs the outward normals are (0, 0, 1) and (0, 0,&minus;1) respectively.
On the curved surface F &middot; n = 0 since x2 + y2 = 1 and the third coordinate of n</p>

<p>V

</p>
<p>on the unit disc and equals π/4.
</p>
<p>Example 15.3 We use the divergence theorem to evaluate
</p>
<p>&int;&int;
</p>
<p>&part;W
</p>
<p>(x2 + y + z)
</p>
<p>where W is the solid sphere x2 + y2 + z2 &lt; 1 and &part;W is its boundary oriented out-
wards. The unit sphere has outward normal n(x, y, z) = (x, y, z). If F = ( f1, f2, f3)
is a vector field on W then the divergence theorem implies that
</p>
<p>&int;&int;
</p>
<p>&part;W
</p>
<p>( f1, f2, f3) =
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>&part;W

<p>&part; f3
</p>
<p>&part;z

<p>)
</p>
<p>dxdydz. (15.2)
</p>
<p>Hence we can use any smooth vector field on the closed unit sphere for which
</p>
<p>x f1+ y f2+z f3 = x2+ y+z. This allows a wide choice but in such cases the simplest</p>

<p>Example 15.4 In this example we verify a particular case of the divergence theorem.
</p>
<p>Let U denote the set defined by the inequalities z &ge; 0, x2 + y2 + z2 &le; 4 and
x2 + y2 &le; z2. These define the set of points, above the xy-plane, contained in the
sphere of radius 2 centred at the origin, which lie within the cone x2 + y2 &le; z2
(Fig. 15.2).
</p>
<p>The boundaries of the solid sphere and cone are given by the equalities x2 + y2 +
z2 = 4 and x2 + y2 = z2 respectively. These intersect in a curve which satisfies both
equations, i.e. x2 + y2 + z2 = 4 = z2 + z2. Hence z = &plusmn;
</p>
<p>&radic;
2 and x2 + y2 = 2. This
</p>
<p>is a circle of radius
&radic;
</p>
<p>2 parallel to the xy-plane,
&radic;
</p>
<p>2 units above it with centre at the
</p>
<p>point (0, 0,
&radic;
</p>
<p>2). The open set U is that portion of the cone which lies between the
</p>
<p>planes z = 0 and z =
&radic;
</p>
<p>2 capped by the top of the sphere (Fig. 15.3). The boundary
</p>
<p>ofU consists of the portion S1 of the cone defined by x
2+ y2 = z2, 0 &le; z &le;
</p>
<p>&radic;
2, and
</p>
<p>the portion of the sphere, S2, defined by x
2 + y2 + z2 = 4,
</p>
<p>&radic;
2 &le; z &le; 2. Consider
</p>
<p>the vector field
</p>
<p>F(x, y, z) = (xz, yz, x2 + y2).
</p>
<p>We have div(F) =

<p>diagrams, parametrizations and linear algebra and seen that problems in integration
</p>
<p>theory are handled by a mixture of techniques and ideas. With some practice readers
</p>
<p>will find their own preferred approach and, indeed, recognise that there are alternative
</p>
<p>approaches to a number of problems. Our next example is similar but somewhat more
</p>
<p>complicated than the previous example. We could take the same approach but instead
</p>
<p>use a few different ideas (some call them tricks) which may be useful elsewhere. This
</p>
<p>example also highlights the relationship between the change of variables for triple
</p>
<p>integrals and parametrizations of the boundary surfaces. Recall that we obtained
</p>
<p>many of the change of variables formulae for solids by &ldquo;filling in&rdquo; parametrization
</p>
<p>of boundary surfaces (Example 14.4). In the next example we see that restricting
</p>
<p>parametrizations of solids to the boundaries leads to parametrizations of surfaces.
</p>
<p>Example 15.5 In this example we verify the divergence theorem on a part of a solid
</p>
<p>torus (Example 11.1). Consider the region A in the yz-plane determined by the
</p>
<p>inequalities (y &minus; b)2 + z2 &le; a and b &minus; y &le; z &le; y &minus; b where b &gt; a &gt; 0. The
boundary of A consists of an arc of a circle of radius a with centre (b, 0) and two
</p>
<p>straight lines which pass through the centre of the circle. These are easily sketched,
</p>
<p>Fig. 15.4, and we will constantly refer to this simple diagram as it contains a great
</p>
<p>deal of information.
</p>
<p>If we revolve A about the z-axis we obtain a wedge-shaped portion U of the solid
</p>
<p>torus (see Fig. 15.4 for a sketch of the torus). We parametrize the solid torus by filling</p>

<p>To verify the divergence theorem we calculate the integral over the boundary of U
</p>
<p>oriented outwards. The boundary of U is obtained by revolving the boundary of
</p>
<p>A about the z-axis. From Fig. 15.4 we see that the boundary of A consists of an
</p>
<p>arc B1 of a circle which revolves into a part of the torus and two straight lines,
</p>
<p>B2 and B3, which revolve into portions of cones. We denote by Si the outwardly
</p>
<p>oriented surface obtained by revolving Bi about the z-axis, i = 1, 2, 3. We could
proceed to parametrize each of these surfaces using the methods developed earlier,
</p>
<p>but instead we obtain our parametrizations by appropriate restrictions of P . For
</p>
<p>example B1 is the boundary of A obtained by letting r = a in the parametrization
(r, θ) &rarr; (b + r cos θ, r sin θ) of A and if we let r = a in P(r, θ, ψ) we obtain a
parametrization f of S1 given by
</p>
<p>f (θ, ψ) =
(
</p>
<p>(b + a cos θ) cosψ, (b + a cos θ) sinψ, a sin θ
)
</p>
<p>where &minus;π/4 &lt; θ &lt; π/4 and 0 &lt; ψ &lt; 2π . Since partial derivatives are calcu-
lated by fixing all except one of the variables we have fθ (θ,ψ) = Pθ (a, θ, ψ) and
fψ (θ, ψ) = Pψ (a, θ, ψ). Thus the partial derivatives of f are the final two columns
of P &prime; and as the columns of P &prime; are mutually perpendicular the first column is parallel
to the normal of S1. Since the first column of P
</p>
<p>&prime; is a unit vector it follows that the
unit normals to S1 are</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188 15 The Divergence Theorem
</p>
<p>&plusmn;(cos θ cosψ, cos θ sinψ, sin θ).
</p>
<p>If θ = 0 and ψ = π/2 we get the point (0, b + a, 0) in S1 with unit normals at
this point given by &plusmn;(0, 1, 0). From Fig. 15.4 the outward normal is (0, 1, 0). Hence
the outward normal at any point of S1 is given by (cos θ cosψ, cos θ sinψ, sin θ).
</p>
<p>Again, using orthogonality of the columns of P we see that
</p>
<p>‖ fθ &times; fψ‖ = ‖ fθ‖ &middot; ‖ fψ‖ = a(b + a cos θ).
</p>
<p>On S1, x
2 + y2 = (b + a cos θ)2 cos2 ψ + (b + a cos θ)2 sin2 ψ = (b + a cos θ)2
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>F = (a (b + a cos θ) cosψ cos θ, a (b + a cos θ) sinψ cos θ, a sin θ (b + a cos θ))

<p>The boundary B2 of A is obtained by letting θ = π/4 in the parametrization (r, θ) &rarr;
(b + r cos θ, r sin θ) of A and hence a parametrization of S2 is obtained by letting
θ = π/4 in P(r, θ, ψ). This gives the parametrization

<p>with domain 0 &le; ψ &le; 2π , 0 &le; r &le; a. As before the partial derivatives of g are
obtained from the first and third columns of P &prime;, with θ = π/4, and again, using
orthogonality of the rows of P &prime;, we see that the unit normals to S2 are obtained by</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>normalising the second column of P &prime;. The normals are &plusmn;(cosψ, sinψ,&minus;1)/
&radic;

<p>2.
</p>
<p>From Fig. 15.4 the outer normal has a positive final coordinate and thus the outer
</p>
<p>normal at the point g(r, ψ) is (&minus; sinψ,&minus; cosψ, 1)/
&radic;

<p>Geometry of Surfaces in R3
</p>
<p>Summary Using normal sections we define normal curvature, principal curvatures
</p>
<p>and Gaussian curvature. Geometric interpretations and a method of calculating the
</p>
<p>Gaussian curvature using parametrization are given.
</p>
<p>Our geometric study of surfaces in R3 is motivated by some very simple basic ques-
</p>
<p>tions such as; what is curvature and how does one measure it? Is there any relationship
</p>
<p>between surface area and curvature? What is the shortest distance between two points
</p>
<p>on a surface? We start by taking an intuitive and non-rigorous look at an apparently
</p>
<p>very special case and this leads us to mathematical concepts which are both useful
</p>
<p>and natural. The surface we study is one with which we are already familiar and
</p>
<p>this simple example gives us everything. We have already used all the techniques
</p>
<p>that we require, and all the facts that we need are known to us&mdash;we just have to
</p>
<p>look at things in a slightly different way. The surface S we consider is the graph
</p>
<p>of the smooth function f where f (x, y) is the height above sea level. We suppose
</p>
<p>f has a local maximum at (x0, y0) and we study S near p =
(
</p>
<p>x0, y0, f (x0, y0)
)
.
</p>
<p>Since the point (x0, y0) is a critical point of f the tangent plane to S at p is the
</p>
<p>plane through the point (x0, y0, f (x0, y0)) parallel to the xy-plane in R
3. The unit
</p>
<p>normals to the surface at p are &plusmn;(0, 0, 1) and, for convenience, we choose (0, 0, 1)
as our unit normal n(p). The tangent plane of S at p consists of all vectors of the
</p>
<p>form (v1, v2, 0).
</p>
<p>If our notion of curvature is meaningful it should say something when we take
</p>
<p>cross-sections of a surface. For instance, if we keep getting circles when we take
</p>
<p>cross-sections we should not be surprised if the surface is a sphere and if each cross-
</p>
<p>section is either a line or a plane we expect the surface to be a plane. We consider
</p>
<p>cross-sections of R3 through the point p which contain the unit normal at p, n(p).
</p>
<p>Since cross-sections of R3 are two-dimensional this will cut the tangent plane and
</p>
<p>we can find a unit tangent vector at p, v, such that our cross-section has the form
</p>
<p>p + {xv + yn(p) : x, y &isin; R2}.
</p>
<p>We identify this cross-section of R3 with R2

</p>
<p>The intersection of this cross-section of R3 and the surface S is a curve on the surface
</p>
<p>called a normal section of the surface at p (Fig. 16.1).
</p>
<p>Using this correspondence we may identify the normal section of the surface with
</p>
<p>a curve Ŵ in R2 passing through the origin. We direct Ŵ by requiring (0, 1) to be
</p>
<p>the unit normal at the origin and calculate its curvature using the concept of plane
</p>
<p>curvature in Chap. 7. The curvature of Ŵ at the origin in R2 will depend on the
</p>
<p>unit vector v and the choice of normal and we denote it by kp(v). We call kp(v)
</p>
<p>the normal curvature of S at p in the direction v. By examining kp(v) as v ranges
</p>
<p>over all unit tangent vectors to S at p we hope to draw conclusions on the shape
</p>
<p>of the surface near p. For example, if kp(v) = 1/r for all v then we might expect
the surface to approximate a sphere of radius r near p. All normal sections are
</p>
<p>paths on the surface leading to the point p (i.e. to the top of the mountain) and the
</p>
<p>different normal curvatures distinguish between the steep and the not so steep paths.
</p>
<p>Visualising circles of different radii going through p, with p as their highest point,
</p>
<p>gives us an idea of the shape of the surface near p. Of course it is very laborious to
</p>
<p>examine all these curves and to calculate all their curvatures so instead we examine
</p>
<p>them collectively to see if any particular features of the set of all normal curvatures
</p>
<p>captures the essence of the shape near p.
</p>
<p>Since f has a local maximum at (x0, y0) and n(p) = (0, 0, 1) all normal circles
of curvature will lie on the same side of the tangent plane and on the opposite side
</p>
<p>to the normal. This means that all normal curvatures will be negative. Choosing
</p>
<p>(0, 0,&minus;1) as unit normal at p changes the signs of all normal curvatures. If we were
examining a local minimum at (x0, y0) and n(p) = (0, 0, 1) we would have found
that all normal curvatures were positive.
</p>
<p>But changing the normal or turning the surface upside down&mdash;this is equivalent
</p>
<p>to changing local maxima into local minima and conversely&mdash;does not affect the
</p>
<p>shape of the surface in any way and we conclude: if all normal curvatures are strictly
</p>
<p>positive or all are strictly negative then the shape of S near p is similar to an ellipsoid
</p>
<p>(Fig. 16.2). These points are called elliptic points of the surface. We can extend</p>

<p>this analysis to arbitrary critical points and clearly if, at a point p, normal curvature
</p>
<p>takes both positive and negative values then the surface near p is similar in shape to a
</p>
<p>saddle point. Such points are called hyperbolic points of the surface. Our preliminary
</p>
<p>investigation has shown that information on the shape of the surface can be obtained
</p>
<p>from the range of values taken by kp(v) as v varies over the set of unit tangent vectors
</p>
<p>at p. Since the range is determined by the extremal values we let k1(p) = max
‖v‖=1
</p>
<p>kp(v)
</p>
<p>and k2(p) = min
‖v‖=1
</p>
<p>kp(v) and call k1(p) and k2(p) the principal curvatures at p. If the
</p>
<p>maximum or minimum occurs at a vector v we call v a principal curvature direction.
</p>
<p>We consider the various possibilities that may arise for k1(p) and k2(p). If k1(p) =
k2(p) then we call p an umbilic point and if k1(p) = k2(p) = 0 we call p a flat spot.
If p is umbilic then kp(v) = k1(p) for all v, ‖v‖ = 1, and if k1(p) �= 0 then the
surface near p is similar to a portion of a sphere of radius 1/|k1(p)|. If p is a flat spot
then all normal curvatures are zero and the surface near p is very flat and almost like
</p>
<p>a part of a plane. At an umbilic point all directions are principal curvature directions.
</p>
<p>We now consider non-umbilic points, i.e. k1(p) &gt; k2(p). If k2(p) &gt; 0 then for any
</p>
<p>v, ‖v‖ = 1, we have 0 &lt; k2(p) &le; kp(v) and if k1(p) &lt; 0 then kp(v) &le; k1(p) &lt; 0
for all v, ‖v‖ = 1. Hence, in both cases, all normal curvatures have the same sign and
near p the surface is shaped like an ellipsoid at one of its extreme points (i.e. like the
</p>
<p>surface (x/a)2 + (y/b)2 + (z/c)2 = 1 at the point (0, 0, c) ). If k2(p) &lt; 0 &lt; k1(p)
then the surface near p is shaped like a saddle point.
</p>
<p>To summarise our conclusions more concisely we introduce Gaussian curvature.
</p>
<p>Definition 16.1 The Gaussian curvature, K (p), at a point p on a surface S, is the
</p>
<p>product of the principal curvatures, k1(p)k2(p).
</p>
<p>We have noted already that kp(v) depends on the choice of normal&mdash;changing the
</p>
<p>normal changes the sign of kp(v)&mdash;but since two changes of sign cancel one another
</p>
<p>it follows that K (p) does not depend on the choice of normal.
</p>
<p>Although we have only considered critical points on the graph in our analysis we
</p>
<p>will see shortly that our analysis applies to all points on a surface and for this reason
</p>
<p>we state the following result in its full generality.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>196 16 Geometry of Surfaces in R3
</p>
<p>Proposition 16.2 At a non-umbilic point on a surface S in R3 we have:
</p>
<p>K (p) &gt; 0 &lArr;&rArr; near p, S is shaped like an ellipsoid,
K (p) &lt; 0 &lArr;&rArr; near p, S is shaped like a saddle point,
K (p) = 0 &lArr;&rArr; near p, S is shaped like a cylinder or cone.
</p>
<p>At an umbilic point K (p) &ge; 0 and
</p>
<p>K (p) &gt; 0 &lArr;&rArr; near p, S is shaped like a sphere,
K (p) = 0 &lArr;&rArr; near p, S is very flat.
</p>
<p>Consider again the graph of a function f near a critical point (x0, y0).We suppose
</p>
<p>for simplicity that (x0, y0) = (0, 0) and f (0, 0) = 0. The tangent plane at p =
(x0, y0, f (0, 0)) = (0, 0, 0) is the xy-plane and consists of the points {(v1, v2, 0) :
v1, v2 &isin; R}, and n = n(p) = (0, 0, 1) is our choice of unit normal. Let v =
(v1, v2, 0) be a fixed unit vector. The section of R
</p>
<p>3 determined by n and v is the
</p>
<p>plane
</p>
<p>{(tv1, tv2, s) : t, s &isin; R} (16.1)
</p>
<p>and the graph of f is the set
</p>
<p>{(x, y, f (x, y)) : (x, y) &isin; domain( f )}. (16.2)
</p>
<p>The points which satisfy both (16.1) and (16.2) form the normal section of the surface
</p>
<p>through p defined by v and are easily seen near p to have the form
</p>
<p>{(tv1, tv2, f (tv1, tv2)), t &isin; [&minus;a, a]} = {tv + f (tv1, tv2)n : t &isin; [&minus;a, a]} (16.3)
</p>
<p>for some positive a.
</p>
<p>On identifying the plane in R3 spanned by v and n with R2
(x,y) we see that the
</p>
<p>normal section can be parameterised by
</p>
<p>P(t) = (t, f (tv1, tv2)), t &isin; [&minus;a, a],
</p>
<p>and may be identified with the graph of the function h : [&minus;a, a] &rarr; R, h(t) =
f (tv1, tv2). If we parametrize the graph of h by t &rarr;
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>t, h(t)
)
</p>
<p>we obtain (1, 0) as
</p>
<p>unit tangent at (0, 0) and (0, 1) as unit normal (see Chap. 7). Hence the curvature of
</p>
<p>the graph at the origin, directed by this parametrization, is the normal curvature of
</p>
<p>S at p in the direction v. By Example 7.1 the curvature at (t, h(t)) is
</p>
<p>h&prime;&prime;(t)
</p>
<p>(1 + h&prime;(t)2)3/2
.</p>

</p>
<p>is the Hessian of f at (0, 0). (We have taken the liberty of using v to denote both
</p>
<p>(v1, v2) and (v1, v2, 0) and hope that this does not cause any confusion&mdash;it is a
</p>
<p>practice that we do not recommend except in special circumstances.)
</p>
<p>This is familiar territory and we use our knowledge of the function vH f (0,0)
tv
</p>
<p>as v ranges over all unit vectors. In Chap. 4 we showed that the maximum and
</p>
<p>minimum values of vH f (0,0)
tv over ‖v‖ = 1 are the eigenvalues of H f (0,0) and are
</p>
<p>achieved at the corresponding eigenvectors. Hence the eigenvectors of H f (0, 0) are
</p>
<p>the principal curvature directions and p is non-umbilic if and only if H f (0, 0) has
</p>
<p>two distinct eigenvalues. Since eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues
</p>
<p>are perpendicular (Exercise 1.21) it follows that at a non-umbilic point there exist
</p>
<p>precisely two principal curvature directions which are perpendicular to one another&mdash;
</p>
<p>hence if we know one we can easily find the other. Note that we do not distinguish
</p>
<p>between the directions v and &minus;v.
We now discuss the case previously omitted, i.e. K (p) = 0, which corresponds to
</p>
<p>a degenerate critical point of the function f . If K (p) = 0 and p is umbilic then since
K (p) = k1(p)k2(p) and k1(p) = k2(p) it follows that k1(p) = k2(p) = 0 and p is
a flat spot and we have already considered this case. If K (p) = 0 and p is not umbilic
then we have two possibilities, k2(p) &lt; 0 = k1(p) and k2(p) = 0 &lt; k1(p), and
which occurs depends on the choice of normal. Since both have the same geometrical
</p>
<p>interpretation we just consider the first one. If v is the principal curvature direction
</p>
<p>associated with k1(p), i.e. kv(p) = k1(p), then the normal section near p in the
direction v is approximately a straight line. If w &perp; v = 0 then w is the other principal
curvature direction and the normal section in this direction is approximately a circle
</p>
<p>of radius 1/|k2(p)| on the opposite side of the surface to the normal (Fig. 16.3a, b).
Figure 16.3b suggests a cylinder as an example and indeed a cylinder has Gaussian
</p>
<p>curvature zero at all points. For the cylinder in Fig. 16.3c we have k1(p) = 0 and
k2(p) = &minus;1/r . In general, if K (p) = 0 then all normal circles of curvature will lie
on the same side of the tangent plane and all normal curvatures will have the same
</p>
<p>sign, that is, either all non-negative or all non-positive. The cylinder and cone (see
</p>
<p>Exercise 16.2) are typical examples of surfaces without umbilics and with K (p) = 0.
One should, however, not assume that every surface with K (p) = 0 is of this type as</p>

<p>one can find quite strange surfaces with K (p) = 0 at isolated points. Our geometric
interpretations are meant as a rough guide and as such are reasonably useful in
</p>
<p>visualising the shape of the surface but do not, of course, explain the full subtlety of
</p>
<p>many situations&mdash;this requires further analysis.
</p>
<p>So far we have considered a rather special situation&mdash;a critical point on a surface
</p>
<p>which is the graph of a function&mdash;and it is time to see how representative this is of
</p>
<p>the general situation.
</p>
<p>What about non-critical points? Well, if looked at the right way, every point is a
</p>
<p>critical point. For example, consider the torus in R3 and take p as a typical point
</p>
<p>on the surface (Fig. 16.4a). To turn p into a critical point we must choose a new
</p>
<p>coordinate system for R3. We choose our first two coordinates so that the tangent
</p>
<p>plane to the surface at p corresponds to the (x, y)-plane and then take the z-direction
</p>
<p>as one of the normal directions (Fig. 16.4b).
</p>
<p>We define a function φ on the tangent plane near p by letting φ(x, y) denote
</p>
<p>the distance squared from the tangent plane in the n(p) direction to the surface
</p>
<p>(Fig. 16.5). This means that the surface S near p is the graph of φ and that φ, defined</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>16 Geometry of Surfaces in R3 199
</p>
<p>on the tangent space near p, has a local minimum at p. One can carry out a similar
</p>
<p>analysis at any point on the surface, although it is not so easy to sketch at points
</p>
<p>which become saddle points, e.g. the point q in Fig. 16.4a.
</p>
<p>We conclude that our analysis applies everywhere on a graph. Our examination
</p>
<p>of graphs, level sets, simple surfaces and surfaces at the end of Chap. 10 shows that
</p>
<p>these objects are locally equivalent and since normal curvature, principal curvatures
</p>
<p>and Gaussian curvature are locally defined our results obtained using graphs are valid
</p>
<p>at all points on all surfaces.
</p>
<p>Gaussian curvature is the most important number that we can geometrically asso-
</p>
<p>ciate with a point on a surface. To use it effectively we need to be able to calculate
</p>
<p>it directly from any parametrization, without first finding normal curvatures or prin-
</p>
<p>cipal curvatures. To find a way to do this we turn again to normal curvatures and
</p>
<p>results from Chaps. 7 and 8 on the curvature of plane curves. If P is a unit speed
</p>
<p>parametrized curve in R2 then
</p>
<p>P &prime;(t) = T (t), T &prime;(t) = κ(t)N (t), κ(t) = 〈T &prime;(t), N (t)〉. (16.4)
</p>
<p>Let φ denote a parametrization of the simple surface S. Let p &isin; S, v &isin;
Tp(S), ‖v‖ = 1, and let n(p)denote a choice of normal to S at p. Let P : [&minus;a, a] &minus;&rarr;
Ŵ be a parameterized curve in S with P(0) = p and P &prime;(0) = v. If s denotes the
length function on Ŵ defined by P and Q = P ◦ s&minus;1 then (see Chap. 5 and (8.9)),
</p>
<p>P &prime;&prime;(t) = (s&prime;(t))2Q&prime;&prime;(s(t))+ s&prime;&prime;(t)Q&prime;(s(t)).
</p>
<p>Since s&prime;(0) = 1 and Q&prime;(s(0)) &perp; n(p), (16.4) implies
</p>
<p>〈P &prime;&prime;(0),n(p)〉 = 〈Q&prime;&prime;(s(0)),n(p)〉 = kp(v). (16.5)
</p>
<p>Since Ŵ &sub; S we may suppose
</p>
<p>P : t &isin; [&minus;a, a] �&rarr; φ(x(t), y(t))
</p>
<p>where t �&rarr; x(t) and y �&rarr; y(t) are real-valued smooth functions on [&minus;a, a]. By the
chain rule
</p>
<p>P &prime;(t) = x &prime;(t)φx (x(t), y(t))+ y&prime;(t)φy(x(t), y(t))

</p>
<p>The appearance of EG &minus; F2, previously encountered while calculating surface
area in Proposition 16.3, suggests a relationship between Gaussian curvature and

<p>surface area. This comes to light in the Gauss&ndash;Bonnet theorem (Chap. 18).
</p>
<p>Example 16.4 We calculate the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = xy. This
surface is the graph of the function f (x, y) = xy and we obtain a parametrization φ
by letting φ(x, y) = (x, y, xy). We have
</p>
<p>φx = (1, 0, y), φy = (0, 1, x)
E = φx .φx = 1 + y2, F = φx .φy = xy, G = φy .φy = 1 + x2

</p>
<p>Since the Gaussian curvature is always strictly negative the surface z = xy consists
entirely of non-umbilic points which, looked at critically, are saddle points.
</p>
<p>Although, in general, it may be difficult to find principal curvatures and principal
</p>
<p>curvature directions it is possible in special cases and this is the content of the
</p>
<p>following proposition. We say that a curve Ŵ on a surface is a line of curvature if its
</p>
<p>tangents are principal curvature directions at each point.
</p>
<p>Proposition 16.5 If φ : U &sub; R2 &rarr; S is a parametrized surface then the coordinate
curves of φ are lines of curvature if and only if F = m = 0 at all non-umbilic points.
In this case, at non-umbilic points, the principal curvatures are l/E and n/G.
</p>
<p>Proof Fix p &isin; S and suppose the principles curvatures at p are λ1 and λ2, λ1 �= λ1.
Since the lines of curvature passing through p cross one another at right angles it
</p>
<p>follows, if the coordinate curves are lines of curvature, that F = φx &middot; φy = 0. Since
the vectors (1, 0) and (0, 1) solve (16.8) we obtain after making these substitutions
</p>
<p>l &minus; λE = m = n &minus; λG = 0. In particular, we see that m = 0 and note also
{λ1, λ2} = { lE ,
</p>
<p>n
G
}.
</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose F = m = 0 at all non-umbilic points. By (16.6)

that {λ1, λ2} =

<p>Example 16.6 The surface obtained by rotating the graph of h : (a, b) &rarr; R
(Example 10.4) is parametrized by
</p>
<p>P(t, θ) = (t, h(t) cos θ, h(t) sin θ).
</p>
<p>For this parametrization Pt = (1, h&prime; cos θ, h&prime; sin θ) and Pθ = (0,&minus;h sin θ, h cos θ).
Hence E = 1 + (h&prime;)2, F = 0, G = h2,

<p>Pθθ = (0, &minus;h cos θ, &minus;h sin θ).
</p>
<p>Moreover,

</p>
<p>An interesting case occurs when h(t) = c cosh(t/c). This is the shape assumed
by a hanging chain and is called a catenary. The surface of revolution is called a
</p>
<p>catenoid. Using the identities
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
(cosh t) = sinh t,
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
(sinh t) = cosh t, cosh2 t &minus; sinh2 t = 1,
</p>
<p>we see that the principal curvatures for the catenoid are&plusmn;1/c cosh2(t/c). Hence k1 +
k2 = 0. A surface with this property is called a minimal surface. This terminology
arose in the following way. Take a closed curve in R3&mdash;shaped, for instance, from a
</p>
<p>piece of wire&mdash;and place a bubble over it. This will assume a certain shape in order
</p>
<p>to minimise a physical quantity on the boundary called surface tension. The shape
</p>
<p>assumed by the bubble is a minimal surface. The catenoid is the only surface of
</p>
<p>revolution which is a minimal surface. On minimal surfaces k2(p) = &minus;k1(p) and
hence
</p>
<p>K (p) = k1(p)k2(p) = &minus;k1(p)2 &le; 0.
</p>
<p>The quantity
k1(p)+ k2(p)
</p>

is called the mean curvature.</p>

<p>Gaussian Curvature
</p>
<p>Summary We define the Weingarten mapping or shape operator. This gives an
</p>
<p>intrinsic approach to Gaussian curvature.
</p>
<p>We first recall, from the previous chapter, the concepts introduced and the results
</p>
<p>obtained concerning the shape of a surface near a point p. All these results were
</p>
<p>obtained using plane curvature in R2. We defined or obtained the following:
</p>
<p>(a) kp(v), the normal curvature at p in the direction of the unit tangent vector v at
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>(b) principal curvatures at p, k1(p) and k2(p), where
</p>
<p>k1(p) = max
‖v‖=1
</p>
<p>kp(v) and k2(p) = min
‖v‖=1
</p>
<p>kp(v)
</p>
<p>(c) principal curvature directions, i.e. tangent vectors v1 and v2 such that
</p>
<p>kp(vi ) = ki (p) for i = 1, 2
</p>
<p>(d) umbilic points, i.e. points where k1(p) = k2(p), andflat spots, i.e. where k1(p) =
k2(p) = 0
</p>
<p>(e) at an umbilic point all (tangential) directions are principal curvature directions;
</p>
<p>at a non-umbilic point there are precisely two principal curvature directions v1
and v2 which are perpendicular to one another
</p>
<p>(f) Gaussian curvature at p
</p>
<p>K (p) = k1(p)k2(p) =
ln &minus; m2

<p>EG &minus; F2

</p>
<p>The Gaussian curvature contains less information than the principal curvatures,
</p>
<p>that is to say if we know the principal curvatures then we can calculate the Gaussian
</p>
<p>curvature but from the Gaussian curvature alone we cannot calculate the principal
</p>
<p>curvatures. Thus, at first glance, it appears that in using Gaussian curvature we may
</p>
<p>be neglecting important information.
</p>
<p>However, experience and subsequent results show that the information lost is
</p>
<p>generously compensated by other gains. To begin with, Gaussian curvature is a sin-
</p>
<p>gle real number assigned to each point on a surface&mdash;the principal curvatures and
</p>
<p>directions involve two real numbers and two vectors. Thus Gaussian curvature has
</p>
<p>the advantage of simplicity. We have already seen that Gaussian curvature may be
</p>
<p>easily calculated from any parametrization whereas it may be difficult to calculate
</p>
<p>the principal curvatures. The principal curvatures depend, up to a factor &plusmn;1, on the
choice of normal while Gaussian curvature has the same value for any choice of
</p>
<p>normal. In practice this means that any parametrization may be used to calculate
</p>
<p>Gaussian curvature while only parametrizations consistent with the choice of nor-
</p>
<p>mal may be used to find principal curvatures. Indeed, along these lines, we have
</p>
<p>a celebrated theorem of Gauss&mdash;theorema egregium&mdash;which asserts that Gaussian
</p>
<p>curvature is an intrinsic property of the surface. Roughly speaking this says that
</p>
<p>Gaussian curvature may be calculated directly from functions defined internally on
</p>
<p>the surface and without using such external properties as the normal or the fact
</p>
<p>that the surface lies in R3. Our method of calculating K uses the normal so Gauss&rsquo;
</p>
<p>theorem tells us that there is another way of calculating K which does not use the
</p>
<p>normal. At first glance this may appear a rather minor point but it was this result
</p>
<p>which paved the way for the development of a very powerful and a very general
</p>
<p>type of geometry&mdash;Riemannian geometry&mdash;in which the key concepts are differ-
</p>
<p>entiation and the length of tangent vectors. Thus for simplicity, for practical and
</p>
<p>intrinsic reasons, Gaussian curvature has many advantages. However, in studying
</p>
<p>surfaces all of the concepts we discussed play a useful role and none should be
</p>
<p>neglected.
</p>
<p>So far we have studied the shape of a surface by examining curves (normal sec-
</p>
<p>tions) of the surface but there are other intuitive approaches to the same problem.
</p>
<p>Almost invariably they lead back to Gaussian curvature. For example, following the
</p>
<p>successful approach to plane curvature obtained by taking limits of circles, it is nat-
</p>
<p>ural to regard the reciprocal of the radius of the sphere that sits closest to the surface
</p>
<p>near p as a measure of the curvature at p. For surfaces the definition of the sphere
</p>
<p>of closest fit is not so obvious, especially at saddle points, and an indirect approach
</p>
<p>is taken. We use a normal n to project the surface near p onto the unit sphere in R3</p>

S is a sphere of radius r then n(x) = &plusmn;x/r for all x &isin; S and K (p) = 1/r2. Further
geometric interpretations appear in the final chapter.
</p>
<p>We list now a number of results on Gaussian curvature which give some idea of
</p>
<p>its uses; more advanced and deeper results are given later. Think about these results,
</p>
<p>ask yourself if they are geometrically plausible, how they fit in with your intuition,
</p>
<p>what they say about the surfaces with which you are already familiar, and how you
</p>
<p>might go about proving them.
</p>
<p>(i) If S is a connected surface in R3 consisting entirely of umbilics then S is either
</p>
<p>an open subset of a sphere or a plane.
</p>
<p>(ii) Every compact surface in R3 contains a point p with K (p) &gt; 0.
</p>
<p>(iii) A compact connected surface of constant Gaussian curvature is a sphere.
</p>
<p>(iv) Hilbert&rsquo;s Lemma: If p is a non-umbilic point in S, k1 has a local maximum at
</p>
<p>p and k2 has a local minimum at p, then K (p) &le; 0.
</p>
<p>Example 17.1 In this example we discuss the torus. From Fig. 17.1 we see that at
</p>
<p>the point p the surface lies on one side of the tangent plane and K (p) &gt; 0 while at q
</p>
<p>it lies on both sides and K (q) &lt; 0. From Figs. 17.1 and 17.2 it is clear that 1/a will
</p>
<p>always be a principal curvature and that 1/b&minus;a (respectively 1/b+a) is a principal
curvature at p (respectively q). We confirm this in our analysis.
</p>
<p>We use toroidal polar coordinates for our parametrization,
</p>
<p>P : (θ, φ) &rarr; ((b + a cos θ) cosφ, (b + a cos θ) sin φ, a sin θ)
</p>
<p>(θ, φ) &isin; (0, 2π) &times; (0, 2π). From Examples 11.1 and 14.5, E = a2, F = 0,
G = (b + a cos θ)2, and</p>

</p>
<p>We now have a formula for Gaussian curvature and also a diagram (Fig. 17.2) and we
</p>
<p>may compare and combine them. By differentiating K (θ, φ), which only depends
</p>
<p>on θ , we can locate the points of maximum and minimum Gaussian curvature, p
</p>
<p>and q, and this confirms what the sketch tells us. For the torus F = m = 0. Hence
(&minus;a sin θ cosφ,&minus;a sin θ sinψ, a cos θ) and (&minus;(b + a cos θ) sinψ, (b + a cos θ)
cosψ, 0) are principal curvature directions and the principal curvatures, associated
</p>
<p>with toroidal polar coordinates, are 1/a and cos θ/(b + a cos θ).
</p>
<p>We now consider a more intrinsic approach to Gaussian curvature. If F : S &minus;&rarr;

<p>where P : [&minus;a, a] &minus;&rarr; Ŵ is any parametrized curve in S with P(0) = p and
P &prime;(0) = v. It can be shown that this definition does not depend on Ŵ or P . The
mapping v &minus;&rarr; DvF(p) is a linear mapping.
</p>
<p>Let φ : U &minus;&rarr; S denote a parametrization of a part of S. Here we use φx to
denote the mapping φ(U ) &cap; S &minus;&rarr; R3 given by
</p>
<p>φx (φ(x, y)) =
d

<p>dt
(φ(x + t, y))

</p>
<p>. (17.2)
</p>
<p>Using (17.1) and (17.2) we define Dφxφx , Dφxφy , Dφyφx and Dφyφy . The expres-
</p>
<p>sions for these derivatives may initially appear cumbersome, e.g. for instance
</p>

</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>However, since φ is a parametrization all its partial derivatives exist and hence,
</p>
<p>using a two variables Taylor series expansion, we see that
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>Dφyφx
)
</p>
<p>(φ(x, y)) =
&part;2φ
</p>
<p>&part;y&part;x
(x, y). (17.3)
</p>
<p>We now use the notation φxx , φxy, φyx and φyy , respectively, in place of Dφxφx ,
</p>
<p>Dφxφy , Dφyφx and Dφyφy . By (17.3), φxy = φyx (see also the introduction to
Chap. 4).
</p>
<p>The product rule for differentiation and 〈n(p),n(p)〉 = 1 imply
</p>
<p>〈Dvn(p),n(p)〉 + 〈n(p), Dvn(p)〉 = 0
</p>
<p>i.e. 〈Dvn(p),n(p)〉 = 0 at any point p &isin; S and any v &isin; Tp(S). Hence Dvn(p) &perp;
n(p) and Dvn(p) belongs to the tangent space at p. This allows us to define a linear
</p>
<p>mapping from the tangent space at p into itself by letting
</p>
<p>L p : v &isin; Tp(S) &minus;&rarr; &minus;Dvn(p) &isin; Tp(S).
</p>
<p>This important mapping is called theWeingartenmapping or shape operator. We now
</p>
<p>suppose that φ is consistent with the orientation and write n in place of n (φ(x, y)).
</p>
<p>Since

n(φ(x + t, y))|t=0 = Dφx n = &minus;L pφx .

</p>
<p>we have proved, in view of Proposition 16.3, the following result.
</p>
<p>Proposition 17.2 If φ parametrizes a surface S in R3 then the determinant of the
</p>
<p>matrix of the Weingarten mapping at p with respect to the basis for the tangent space
</p>
<p>induced by φ is the Gaussian curvature of S at p.
</p>
<p>If v = v1φx + v2φy and w = w1φx + w2φy then, by the above,
</p>
<p>〈L p(v),w〉 = 〈L p(v1φx + v2φy), w1φx + w2φy〉
= v1w1〈L pφx , φx 〉 + (v1w2 + v2w1)〈L p(φx ), φy〉 + v2w2〈L p(φy), φy〉
= 〈v, L p(w)〉
</p>
<p>and L p : Tp(S) &minus;&rarr; Tp(S) is a symmetric linear operator. Moreover,

<p>and if v is a unit tangent vector at p then</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17 Gaussian Curvature 213
</p>
<p>〈L p(v), v〉 = kp(v). (17.4)
</p>
<p>Since L p is symmetric we can choose an orthonormal basis {e1, e2} for Tp(S) con-
sisting of eigenvectors for L p. Let β1 and β2 denote the corresponding eigenvalues.
</p>
<p>If x, y &isin; R, x2 + y2 = 1 then v = xe1 + ye2 is a unit tangent vector at p and, by
(17.4),
</p>
<p>kp(v) = 〈L p(xe1 + ye2), xe1 + ye2〉
= 〈xβ1e1 + yβ2e2, xe1 + ye2〉
= x2β1〈e1, e1〉 + 2xy〈e1, e2〉 + y2〈e2, e2〉
= x2β1 + y2β2.
</p>
<p>This shows that the principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of L p and the eigenvec-
</p>
<p>tors are the principal curvature directions. Since the matrix for L p with respect
</p>
<p>to this basis is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues as entries we also have
</p>
<p>K (p) = β1β2 = det(L p). We summarise what we have proved in the following
proposition.
</p>
<p>Proposition 17.3 At a point p in a surface S the principal curvatures are the eigen-
</p>
<p>values of L p, the principal curvature directions are the eigenvectors of L p, and the
</p>
<p>Gaussian curvature, K (p), is the determinant of L p with respect to any orthonormal
</p>
<p>basis for Tp(S).
</p>
<p>Example 17.4 If p is umbilic then all normal curvatures are equal. If p is non-umbilic
</p>
<p>and k1, k2, v1, and v2 are the principal curvatures and the corresponding principal
</p>
<p>curvature directions then any unit tangent vector v at p has the form
</p>
<p>v = cos θv1 + sin θv2
</p>
<p>for some real number θ . By Proposition 17.3
</p>
<p>L p(v1) = k1(p)v1 and L p(v2) = k2(p)v2
</p>
<p>and, as p is non-umbilic, 〈v1, v2〉 = 0. By (17.2),
</p>
<p>kp(v) = 〈L p(v), v〉 = 〈L p(cos θv1 + sin θv2), cos θv1 + sin θv2〉
= 〈cos θL p(v1)+ sin θL p(v2), cos θv1 + sin θv2〉
= k1(p) cos2 θ + k2(p) sin2 θ.
</p>
<p>This is known as Euler&rsquo;s formula and shows that normal curvature in any direction
</p>
<p>can be recovered from the principal curvatures and the principal curvature directions.</p>

<p>Geodesic Curvature
</p>
<p>Summary We define geodesic curvature and geodesics. For a curve on a surface
</p>
<p>we derive a formula connecting intrinsic curvature, normal curvature and geodesic
</p>
<p>curvature. We discuss paths of shortest distance, further interpretations of Gaussian
</p>
<p>curvature and introduce, informally and geometrically, a number of important results
</p>
<p>in differential geometry.
</p>
<p>Our study of normal curvature was based on identifying the normal of a curve with
</p>
<p>the normal of the surface. It is also possible to arrange things so that the normal to
</p>
<p>a curve in a surface is a tangent vector to the surface. This leads to a new type of
</p>
<p>curvature, geodesic curvature, that we discuss and interpret in this chapter.
</p>
<p>Let S denote an oriented surface in R3 with smooth unit normal n and let
</p>
<p>P : [a, b] &rarr; Γ &sub; S denote a unit speed parametrized curve on the surface. Since the
tangent space at each point on the surface is two-dimensional and P &prime;(t) is a tangent
vector at P(t) it follows that there are precisely two unit tangent vectors at P(t)
</p>
<p>which are perpendicular to P &prime;(t). We distinguish between them by using the normal
to the surface at P(t), n
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>P(t)
)
, and define the surface normal to Γ at P(t), nS(P(t))
</p>
<p>to be n(P(t)) &times; T (t). To simplify our notation we sometimes write n(t) and nS(t)
in place of n
</p>
<p>(
P(t)
</p>
<p>)
and nS(P(t)), respectively. By construction
</p>
<p>{P &prime;(t) = T (t),nS(t),n(t)}
</p>
<p>is a right-handed orthogonal system, and in particular, an orthonormal basis for R3.
</p>
<p>In Chap. 7 we encountered a similar situation when we obtained the orthonormal
</p>
<p>basis {T, N , B} at a point on a curve Γ . In that case we proceeded to obtain the
Frenet&ndash;Serret equations by differentiation and using properties of the orthonormal
</p>
<p>basis. We follow precisely the same path to a similar end here and obtain real-valued
</p>
<p>functions a(t), b(t) and c(t) such that

<p>In particular we see that

<p>n&prime;S(t) = &minus;a(t)T (t)+ b(t)n(t) (18.2)
</p>
<p>and the &ldquo;part&rdquo; of n&prime;S(t) which &ldquo;lies&rdquo; in the tangent space at P(t) is parallel to T (t).
This equation is similar to Eq. 7.11 in Chap. 7. We define the geodesic curvature of
</p>
<p>Γ at P(t), κg(t), to be a(t). By (18.2)
</p>
<p>κg(t) = &minus;〈n &prime;S(t), T (t)〉 = a(t) .
</p>
<p>The entry b(t) is called the geodesic torsion ofΓ at P(t) and written τg(t). Rewriting
</p>
<p>Eq. (18.2) we obtain
</p>
<p>n&prime;S(t) = &minus;κg(t)T (t)+ τg(t)n(t) .

<p>where we have written κn(t) in place of kP(t)

</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>By (18.3)
</p>
<p>T &prime;(t) = κg(t)nS(t)+ κn(t)n(t) . (18.4)
</p>
<p>but if Γ , as a parametrized curve in R3 has strictly positive curvature, we can add to
</p>
<p>this, by using (7.1&prime;) and (18.4), and obtain
</p>
<p>T &prime;(t) = κ(t)N (t) = κg(t)nS(t)+ κn(t)n(t) . (18.5)
</p>
<p>To avoid confusion between the different types of curvature we call κ the intrinsic

</p>
<p>normal then, since we have chosen our normal nS(t) to lie in the tangent space, this
</p>
<p>and (18.5) suggest that we consider geodesic curvature as the surface curvature of the
</p>
<p>parametrized curve. So far we have only considered a unit speed parametrized curve.
</p>
<p>We define the geodesic curvature of a parametrized curve in an oriented surface as the
</p>
<p>geodesic curvature of a unit speed reparametrization of the curve which preserves the
</p>
<p>original sense of direction. Note that our definition of geodesic curvature is based, as
</p>
<p>was normal curvature, on curvature in R2&mdash;see the introduction to Chap. 7. Since the
</p>
<p>two unit normals at any point on a surface are parallel, Eq. (18.4) shows that |κg|&mdash;
the absolute geodesic curvature&mdash;does not depend on either the choice of normal
</p>
<p>or parametrization. As surfaces can be covered by simple, and hence orientable,
</p>
<p>surfaces it follows that absolute geodesic curvature is well defined for any curve on
</p>
<p>any orientable surface.
</p>
<p>Curves with κg = 0 are said to have zero geodesic curvature. We give a geomet-
rical interpretation of this phenomena and afterwards discuss a practical method for
</p>
<p>identifying such curves. If we are dealing with a curve in R2 then zero curvature
</p>
<p>implies that the curve is a straight line. If we identify R2 with the oriented surface
</p>
<p>R
2
(x,y) in R
</p>
<p>3 and consider a curve Γ in R2 as a curve in R3 then we see easily that its
</p>
<p>plane curvature in R2 coincides with its geodesic curvature in R2
(x,y). In R
</p>
<p>2 we also
</p>
<p>note that a curve is a straight line if and only if it follows the shortest route between
</p>
<p>any pair of its points. Now the tangent plane is the closest plane to the surface near
</p>
<p>a given point p and since geodesic curvature is essentially curvature on the tangent
</p>
<p>plane it is at least plausible that zero geodesic curvature implies that Γ follows the
</p>
<p>shortest path on the surface between points on Γ close to p. This is indeed the case.
</p>
<p>Formally we have the following definitions and results. A surface S is connected
</p>
<p>if between any two points p and q on S there exists at least one path (or directed
</p>
<p>curve) with initial point p and final point q. We define the distance between p and
</p>
<p>q, d(p, q), as
</p>
<p>inf {length(γ ), γ is a path with initial point p and final point q} .
</p>
<p>A path γ joining p and q is a shortest path if
</p>
<p>d(p, q) = length(γ ) .
</p>
<p>Shortest paths may or may not exist and if they exist they may not be unique. For
</p>
<p>instance it is easily seen that there is no shortest path on the surface S = {(x, y, 0) :
0 &lt; x2 + y2 &lt; 2} in R3 joining the points (&minus;1, 0, 0) and (1, 0, 0) although it is easy
to see that the distance between them is 2. On the other hand there exist an infinite
</p>
<p>number of shortest paths on a sphere joining the North and South poles (any line of
</p>
<p>longitude is a shortest path). Equation 18.5 leads to a simple practical criterion for
</p>
<p>identifying unit speed curves of zero geodesic curvature since it is easily seen, using
</p>
<p>(18.5), that P &prime;&prime;(t) (or N (t)) is parallel to n(t), for any choice of normal, if and only
if κg(t) = 0. This motivates the following definition.</p>

<p>220 18 Geodesic Curvature
</p>
<p>Definition 18.1 A parametrized curve P : [a, b] &rarr; Γ &sub; S, where S is a surface in
R
</p>
<p>3, is a geodesic in S if P &prime;&prime;(t) (the acceleration of the parametrization) is parallel to
the normal to the surface at P(t) for all t .
</p>
<p>Our remarks above show that a unit speed parametrized curve is a geodesic if and
</p>
<p>only if it has zero geodesic curvature.
</p>
<p>Proposition 18.2 A parametrized curve P : [a, b] &rarr; Γ &isin; S is a geodesic if and
only if it has constant speed and zero geodesic curvature.
</p>
<p>Proof We may assume, without loss of generality, that [a, b] = [0, α]. We first
suppose that the parametrized curve is a geodesic. We have
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
〈P &prime;(t), P &prime;(t)〉 = 2〈P &prime;&prime;(t), P &prime;(t)〉.
</p>
<p>Since the curve lies in S, P &prime;(t) is a tangent vector at P(t), and as P is a geodesic
P &prime;&prime;(t) is perpendicular to every tangent vector. This implies 〈P &prime;(t), P &prime;&prime;(t)〉 = 0 and
d
</p>
<p>dt
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>‖P &prime;(t)‖2
)
= 0. Hence ‖P &prime;(t)‖ is a constant function of t and the parametrization
</p>
<p>has constant speed c. This implies that the parametrization Q : [0, cα] &rarr; Γ &isin; S,
where Q(t) = P(t/c), is unit speed. Since Q&prime;&prime;(t) = P &prime;&prime;(t/c)/c2, we see that Q&prime;&prime;(t)
is parallel to P &prime;&prime;(t/c) and hence to n(P(t/c)) = n(Q(t)).
</p>
<p>Conversely suppose P : [0, α] &minus;&rarr; S has constant speed, c, and zero geodesic
curvature. Then Q : [0, cα] &minus;&rarr; S where Q(t) = P(t/c) is unit speed and has zero
geodesic curvature. By (18.4), Q&prime;&prime;(t) is parallel to n(t/c) and since P &prime;&prime;(t/c) and
Q&prime;&prime;(t) are parallel this shows that the curve parametrized by P is a geodesic. This
completes the proof. ⊓⊔
</p>
<p>From the above considerations it is not difficult to show that a parametrized curve
</p>
<p>is a geodesic if and only if it satisfies a certain ordinary differential equation. Exis-
</p>
<p>tence theorems for ordinary differential equations show that any surface admits an
</p>
<p>abundance of geodesics. The following is true.
</p>
<p>Proposition 18.3 If S is a surface in R3, p &isin; S and v &isin; Tp(S) is non-zero then
</p>
<p>there exists ε &gt; 0 and a unique geodesic P : [&minus;ε, ε] &rarr; S such that P(0) = p and
</p>
<p>P &prime;(0) = v.
</p>
<p>Example 18.4 Let S2 denote the unit sphere with centre at the origin in R
3. Let v
</p>
<p>and w denote perpendicular unit vectors in R3 and let
</p>
<p>P(t) = cos(at)v + sin(at)w, t &isin; R
</p>
<p>where a is a fixed real number. By Pythagoras&rsquo; Theorem P defines a parametrized
</p>
<p>curve in S2. We have
</p>
<p>P &prime;&prime;(t) = &minus;a2 cos(at)v &minus; a2 sin(at)w = &minus;a2P(t) .</p>

</p>
<p>Since n(t) = &plusmn;P(t) for the unit sphere with centre at the origin this implies P &prime;&prime;(t) ‖
n(t) for all t and P is a geodesic. Proposition 18.3 shows that a geodesic is completely
</p>
<p>determined by its position and velocity at a single point. Since P(0) = v and P &prime;(0) =
</p>
<p>aw it follows that we have found all geodesics on the unit sphere.
</p>
<p>We return to the problem we started with&mdash;the existence of a shortest path. Propo-
</p>
<p>sitions 18.2 and 18.3 show that there are many curves on a surface with zero geodesic
</p>
<p>curvature. From this it is possible to prove the following result which shows, at least
</p>
<p>locally, that there are always shortest paths.
</p>
<p>Proposition 18.5 If p is a point on a surface S in R3 then there exists ε &gt; 0 such
</p>
<p>that for any q in S, d(p, q) &lt; ε, there is a unique shortest path in S joining p and
</p>
<p>q. This path has zero geodesic curvature and may be parametrized as a geodesic.
</p>
<p>Geodesics also lead to a new derivation of Gaussian curvature. Take a point p on
</p>
<p>the surface S. An extension of Proposition 18.3 shows that there exists ε &gt; 0 such
</p>
<p>that for every unit tangent vector v at p the geodesic with initial point p and initial
</p>
<p>velocity v is defined on [0, ε]. If we consider the set of positions taken at time ε by
</p>
<p>all unit speed geodesics starting at p we obtain a curve γε in S. We denote the inside
</p>
<p>of this curve by Aε (Fig. 18.1).
</p>
<p>Thus γε consists of those points in S whose distance to p is ε and Aε are the
</p>
<p>points whose distance to p is less than ε. It can be shown that γε is a closed subset
</p>
<p>of S and Aε is open. If S is flat then γε is a circle of radius ε and length 2πε and
</p>
<p>Aε is a disc of area πε
2. Hence the quantities 2πε &minus; l(γε) and πε
</p>
<p>2&minus;A(Aε) where
</p>
<p>l = length and A = Area are some measure of the curvature of S. In fact, taking
</p>
<p>limits we obtain the following
</p>
<p>K (p) = lim
ε&rarr;0
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>πε3

<p>(

<p>12
</p>
<p>πε4
</p>
<p>(
πε2 &minus; A(Aε)
</p>
<p>)
.
</p>
<p>Thus both normal and geodesic curvature lead quite naturally to Gaussian curvature.
</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the two most important geometrical concepts that we
</p>
<p>associated with a surface&mdash;Gaussian curvature and geodesics&mdash;both turned out to be
</p>
<p>local properties independent of any orientations used for calculations or motivation.
</p>
<p>To complete our introduction to the geometry of surfaces we present without
</p>
<p>proof some rather remarkable results involving the concepts we have introduced.</p>

</p>
<p>These results are easily stated while the proofs are rather involved. Even in the
</p>
<p>absence of any ideas regarding the proofs it is well worth thinking about these results
</p>
<p>and their geometric significance. You may consider verifying them on some of the
</p>
<p>classical surfaces we have studied, e.g. the sphere, ellipsoid or torus. Trying to prove
</p>
<p>them will take some time but if you make the effort and are patient you will learn a
</p>
<p>lot regardless of how successful you are in completing the proofs.
</p>
<p>The first result we discuss is a generalization of the well-known result in Euclidean
</p>
<p>geometry which says that the sum of the interior angles in a (plane) triangle is equal
</p>
<p>to π . This corresponds to the case where the surface is a plane and the Gaussian
</p>
<p>curvature is zero. A triangle in a surface is a simple closed oriented curve formed by
</p>
<p>three smooth directed curves (Fig. 18.2).
</p>
<p>Each of these smooth curves is called an edge, the edges meet at a vertex and the
</p>
<p>interior of the triangle is called its face. A triangle is called a geodesic triangle if
</p>
<p>each edge is a geodesic. In the plane, geodesics are straight lines so the usual triangle
</p>
<p>in the plane is a geodesic triangle. At the vertices P , Q and R the tangents of the two
</p>
<p>curves which meet are in the same tangent space on the surface and we can define
</p>
<p>the angle between them. It is also possible to define what we mean by an interior
</p>
<p>angle (e.g. the angle α at the vertex P). Let A denote the face of the triangle.
</p>
<p>Theorem 18.6 (Local Gauss&ndash;Bonnet Theorem) In a geodesic triangle on a simple
</p>
<p>surface
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>A
</p>
<p>K =
&sum;
</p>
<p>interior angles &minus; π.
</p>
<p>Stokes&rsquo; Theorem plays an important role in the proof. For example consider
</p>
<p>the sphere of radius r . By Example 18.4 the lines of longitude and the equator are
</p>
<p>geodesics. Hence the triangle formed by the lines of longitude corresponding to
</p>
<p>ψ = 0 and ψ = π/2 and the equator are a geodesic triangle (Fig. 18.3).
The three interior angles are all π/2 and the area of the triangle is 1
</p>
<p>8
&times; (total area
</p>
<p>of the sphere) and hence equal to 4πr2/8. Since the Gaussian curvature is 1/r2 this

<p>Any compact (i.e. closed and bounded) oriented surface S in R3 can be partitioned
</p>
<p>into a finite number of triangles each of which is oriented in an anticlockwise direction
</p>
<p>about the normal (Fig. 18.4a). This means that an edge which is in two triangles has
</p>
<p>opposite orientations in each (Fig. 18.4b). Let V denote the total number of vertices,
</p>
<p>E the total number of edges and F the total number of faces.
</p>
<p>A remarkable result of Euler says that no matter how we partition the surface into
</p>
<p>(not necessarily geodesic) triangles the quantity V &minus; E + F remains unchanged. We
call this number the Euler&ndash;Poincar&eacute; characteristic of S and denote it by χ(S). As</p>

<p>a consequence of the local Gauss&ndash;Bonnet Theorem we have the following global

<p>result:
</p>
<p>Theorem 18.7 (Global Gauss&ndash;Bonnet Formula) If S is a compact oriented surface
</p>
<p>then
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>K = 2πχ(S).
</p>
<p>We call
&int;&int;
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>K the total curvature of the surface and it is remarkable that this
</p>
<p>quantity is always an integer multiple of 2π . Applying this to a sphere of radius r
</p>
<p>we find

<p>r2
Surface Area (sphere) =
</p>
<p>4πr2
</p>
<p>r2
= 2πχ(S)
</p>
<p>and see that χ(sphere) = 2.
On the other hand we may partition the sphere by the lines of longitude corre-
</p>
<p>sponding to 0, &plusmn;π/2, π and the equator (Fig. 18.5). The outer edges are on the back
of the sphere and coincide with 180◦ East or 180◦ West (i.e. the international date
</p>
<p>line). By counting we get V = 6, E = 12 and F = 8 and again
</p>
<p>χ (sphere) = 6 &minus; 12 + 8 = 2 .
</p>
<p>Triangles can be replaced by rectangles in calculating the Euler-Poincar&eacute; charac-
</p>
<p>teristic since each rectangle can be partitioned into triangles using diagonals. This
</p>
<p>doubles the number of faces F and adds F new edges. Overall the sum V &minus; E + F
</p>
<p>is unchanged. On a box (Fig. 3.2) we have V = 8, E = 12, F = 6 and hence
</p>
<p>V &minus; E + F = 2. Since a box can be inflated into a sphere this shows once more that
</p>
<p>the Euler-Poincar&eacute; characteristic of the sphere equals 2.</p>

<p>Any compact oriented surface can be smoothly deformed into a surface with a
</p>
<p>finite number of holes (Fig. 18.6). We call the number of holes the genus of the
</p>
<p>surface. This smooth deformation does not change the number of faces, edges or
</p>
<p>vertices of any partition and hence the Euler&ndash;Poincar&eacute; characteristic is unchanged.
</p>
<p>It does, however, change the Gaussian curvature in many places, e.g. the sphere
</p>
<p>can be changed into an ellipsoid and we know that these do not have the same
</p>
<p>Gaussian curvature. The global Gauss&ndash;Bonnet Theorem says that the total curvature
</p>
<p>is unchanged.
</p>
<p>For any compact surface S we have
</p>
<p>χ(S) = 2 &minus; 2g
</p>
<p>where g is the genus. This implies that the Euler&ndash;Poincar&eacute; characteristic is always
</p>
<p>an even integer and the total curvature is an integer multiple of 4π . Thus we have
</p>
<p>a remarkable set of relationships between total curvature, the number V &minus; E + F
and the number of holes on a compact oriented surface S. This is not the end of the
</p>
<p>story as they are all equal to the index of any smooth vector field on S. The index of
</p>
<p>a vector field X , i(X), is obtained by assigning an integer to each zero following a
</p>
<p>prescribed formula. Since χ (sphere) = 2 it follows that every smooth tangent vector
field on a sphere has at least one zero and explains the existence of the bald spot
</p>
<p>which most people usually have at the point of maximal curvature on the midline of
</p>
<p>the calva.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to speculate in a purely geometric way why these things are the
</p>
<p>way they are. For instance, we have seen that the total curvature of a sphere does
</p>
<p>not depend on the radius. Think of blowing up a balloon. The bigger the radius the
</p>
<p>larger the surface area. On the other hand the sphere is becoming less curved, i.e. the
</p>
<p>Gaussian curvature is decreasing, and over the whole surface the increase in surface
</p>
<p>area is counterbalanced by the decrease in curvature. Another simple observation:
</p>
<p>from the formula χ(S) = 2 &minus; 2g we see that adding holes decreases the Euler&ndash;
Poincar&eacute; characteristic and hence adds negative Gaussian curvature to the surface.
</p>
<p>Why should this be so? If we recall our study of the Gaussian curvature of the torus
</p>
<p>(Example 17.1) we noted that at the points P and Q in Fig. 18.6 we had negative
</p>
<p>Gaussian curvature while at R and S we had positive Gaussian curvature. Adding
</p>
<p>holes creates points like P &prime; and Q&prime; while the outside, where the Gaussian curvature</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>226 18 Geodesic Curvature
</p>
<p>is positive, is relatively unchanged and it is at least plausible that we are increasing
</p>
<p>the overall negative Gaussian curvature by adding holes.

<p>1.15 F&minus;1(C) is the intersection of the cone z2 &minus; x2 &minus; y2 = 1 and the plane
2x &minus; y = 2. Solving these equations yields y = 2x &minus; 2 and z2 = 1 + x2 +
4(x &minus; 1)2 = 1 + 5x2 &minus; 8x + 4 = (9/5) + 5(x &minus; 4/5)2. This shows that the
level set is a hyperbola.
</p>
<p>1.19 The level set can be rewritten as y6 + (x &minus; y)2 + (xy &minus; 4z)2 = 51, hence
y6 &lt; 64 and |y| &lt; 2, (x &minus; y)2 &lt; 64 implies |x | &lt; |y| + 8 &lt; 10. Hence
|xy| &lt; 20 and (xy&minus; 4z)2 &lt; 64 implies |4z| &lt; |xy| + 8 &lt; 28. Hence |z| &lt; 7.
This shows that the level set is bounded. It is also closed.

<p>2.5 Equation of plane is ax + by+ cz = d. Using (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5, 6) we obtain
a + 2b + 3c = d and 4a + 5b + 6c = d. Since the plane is perpendicular
to the plane 7x + 8y + 9z = 10 it follows that (a, b, c) &middot; (7, 8, 9) = 0, i.e.
7a+8b+9c = 0. Solving for a, b, c and d gives b = &minus;2a, c = a and d = 0.

and f (0, 0) = 0 implies f has minimum value 0 at (0, 0). The method of
Lagrange multipliers does not work since the surface 3x2 &minus; y5 = 0 does not

<p>3.15 Since &minus;1 &le; cos θ &le; +1, the result in Exercise 2.12 is equivalent to the
Cauchy&ndash;Schwarz inequality. We get the equality case by considering when
</p>
<p>cos θ = &plusmn;1.
3.16 The constraints form a compact subset of R4 so the function has a maxi-
</p>
<p>mum and a minimum. If (x, y, u, v) = (a, 0, b, 0) then (xv &minus; yu)2 = 0
and the minimum is 0. Let c = xv &minus; yu. It suffices to consider c 
= 0. If
(x, y, u, v) = (a, 0, 0, b) then (xv &minus; yu)2 = a2b2 and the maximum is posi-
tive.&nabla;((xv&minus;yu)2) = 2c(v,&minus;u,&minus;y, x) = λ1(2x, 2y, 0, 0)+λ2(0, 0, 2u, 2v),
cv = λ1x, c(&minus;u) = λ1y, c(&minus;y) = λ2u, cx = λ2v. c2v2 + c2u2 = λ21x

2, c2 = cvx&minus;cuy = c(vx&minus;uy) = λ1(x2+y2) = λ1a2.
</p>
<p>Hence λ1 = b2 and c2 = a2b2 = Maximum.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, let x = a cos θ, y = a sin θ, u = b cosφ, v = b sin φ then
(xv&minus; yu)2 = a2b2 sin2(θ&minus;φ) and as sin2(θ&minus;φ) ranges between 0 and 1 we
get the above result. Also this exercise is a special case of the Cauchy-Schwarz

<p>18.2 Unit speed parametrization φ(t) = (x(t), y(t)) &rArr; x &prime;&prime;x &prime; + y&prime;&prime;y&prime; = 0. Note
that ϕ is also unit speed. n(ϕ(t)) ‖ (y&prime;(t),&minus;x &prime;(t) cos θ,&minus;x &prime;(t) sin θ), while
ϕ&prime;&prime;(t) = (x &prime;&prime;(t), y&prime;&prime;(t) cos θ, y&prime;&prime;(t) sin θ) &rArr; ϕ&prime;&prime;(t) = α(t)n(ϕ(t)) where
α(t) = x &prime;&prime;(t)/y&prime;(t) if y&prime;(t) 
= 0 and α(t) = y&prime;&prime;(t)/x &prime;(t) if x &prime;(t) 
= 0. Since
ϕ is a unit speed geodesic (18.5) implies ϕ&prime;&prime;(t) = T &prime;(t) = κn(t)n(ϕ(t)), and
the normal curvature at P(t, θ0) is x
</p>
<p>&prime;&prime;(t)/y&prime;(t), if y&prime;(t) 
= 0, and y&prime;&prime;(t)/x &prime;(t),
if x &prime;(t) 
= 0.
</p>
<p>18.3 If P(t) = a+ tb parametrizes the straight line then P has constant speed and,
since P &prime;&prime;(t) = T &prime;(t) = 0, (18.4) implies the geodesic curvature is zero and,
by Proposition 18.2, straight lines are geodesics. (x0, y0, z0)+ t (a, b, c) lies
in the surface z = x2 &minus; y2 &hArr; (x0 + ta)2 &minus; (y0 + tb)2 = z0 + tc for all
t &hArr; (2x0a &minus; 2y0b &minus; c)t + (a2 &minus; b2)t2 = 0 for all t . Letting a = 1, b =
1, 2x0 &minus; 2y0 = c and a = 1, b = &minus;1, 2x0 + 2y0 = c gives two lines on the
surface.
</p>
<p>18.4 Since P is unit speed T (t) = P &prime;(t) and κn(t) = kP(t)(T (t)). By (18.3),
τg = 0 &hArr; n&prime; = &minus;κnT &hArr; L P(t)(T (t)) = κn(t)T (t) &hArr; T (t) is a principal
curvature for all t &hArr; Ŵ is a line of curvature. Ŵ a geodesic =&rArr; κg = 0 =&rArr;
T &prime; = κN = κnn. Hence N = &plusmn;n, B = T &times; N = T &times; (&plusmn;n) = ∓ns and
&minus;τN = B &prime; = ∓(ns)&prime; = ∓(τgn) = ∓τg(&plusmn;N ) = &minus;τgN and τ = τg .
</p>
<p>18.5 By Proposition 8.1, Ŵ lies in a plane. Using the proof in Example 8.2, we
</p>
<p>see that the non-zero curvature is constant. An application of the result in
</p>
<p>Example 8.4 completes the proof.
</p>
<p>18.6 By (18.5), since the tangent space to S at P(t) is 2 dimensional and T (t) &perp;
N (t), we have kP(t)(T (t)) = 0 &lArr;&rArr; N (t)‖nS(t) &lArr;&rArr; N (P(t)) &isin; TS(P(t))
&lArr;&rArr; TS(P(t)) = span {T (t), N (t)} &lArr;&rArr; tangent plane= osculating plane.
</p>
<p>18.7 Assume sphere has centre at the origin and radius r . Let P be a unit speed
</p>
<p>parametrization of the curve. By (16.5) the normal curvature is &plusmn;1/r and,
by (18.5), κg(t) constant &lArr;&rArr; κ(t) constant. By Example 8.2, κ(t) 
= 0 and
τ (t)〈P(t)&minus;c, B(t)〉 = &minus;( 1
</p>
<p>κ(t)
)&prime; = 0. This implies τ (t) = 0 and Exercise 18.5
</p>
<p>implies the required result.</p>
