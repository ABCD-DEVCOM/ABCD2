<p>Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics (ULNP) publishes authoritative texts covering topics
</p>
<p>throughout pure and applied physics. Each title in the series is suitable as a basis for
</p>
<p>undergraduate instruction, typically containing practice problems, worked examples, chapter
</p>
<p>summaries, and suggestions for further reading.
</p>
<p>ULNP titles must provide at least one of the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; An exceptionally clear and concise treatment of a standard undergraduate subject.
</p>
<p>&bull; A solid undergraduate-level introduction to a graduate, advanced, or non-standard subject.
</p>
<p>&bull; A novel perspective or an unusual approach to teaching a subject.
</p>
<p>ULNP especially encourages new, original, and idiosyncratic approaches to physics teaching
</p>
<p>at the undergraduate level.
</p>
<p>The purpose of ULNP is to provide intriguing, absorbing books that will continue to be the
</p>
<p>reader&rsquo;s preferred reference throughout their academic career.

<p>Preface to the Second Edition
</p>
<p>In the two years since the first edition of this book was published I&rsquo;ve
</p>
<p>received numerous messages from readers all around the world. I
</p>
<p>was surprised by this large number of responses and how positive
</p>
<p>most of them were. Of course, I was cautiously confident that read-
</p>
<p>ers would like the book. Otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t have spent so many
</p>
<p>months writing it. However, there is certainly no shortage of books
</p>
<p>on group theory or on the role of symmetries in physics. To quote
</p>
<p>Predrag Cvitanovic1 1 Predrag Cvitanović. Group Theory:
Birdtracks, Lie&rsquo;s, and Exceptional Groups.
Princeton University Press, 7 2008.
ISBN 9780691118369
</p>
<p>Almost anybody whose research requires sustained use of group
</p>
<p>theory (and it is hard to think of a physical or mathematical problem
</p>
<p>that is wholly devoid of symmetry) writes a book about it.
</p>
<p>Moreover, I&rsquo;m not a world renowned expert. Therefore, I knew no
</p>
<p>one would buy the book because my name is written on the cover. So
</p>
<p>the chances were high that "Physics from Symmetry" would simply
</p>
<p>drown in the flood of new textbooks that are published every year.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s reasonable to wonder: Why and how did "Physics
</p>
<p>from Symmetry" avoid this fate?
</p>
<p>I think the main reason for the success of the first edition is what I
</p>
<p>framed as something negative above: it wasn&rsquo;t written by a world
</p>
<p>renowned expert. I wrote the book while I was still a student and,
</p>
<p>as I remarked in the preface to the first edition, "I wrote the book I
</p>
<p>wished had existed when I started my journey in physics". So my
</p>
<p>motivation for writing the book wasn&rsquo;t to create an authoritative ref-
</p>
<p>erence or a concise text that experts would love. Instead, my only fo-
</p>
<p>cus was to write a book that helps students understand. As a student
</p>
<p>myself I always had still fresh in memory what I found confusing
</p>
<p>and what finally helped me understand.
</p>
<p>This point of view is nicely summarized in the following quote by
</p>
<p>C.S. Lewis2 2 C. S. Lewis. Reflections on the Psalms.
HarperOne, reprint edition, 2 2017.
ISBN 9780062565488It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work
</p>
<p>for one another better than the master can. When you took the problem</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>to a master, as we all remember, he was very likely to explain what
</p>
<p>you understood already, to add a great deal of information which you
</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want, and say nothing at all about the thing that was puzzling
</p>
<p>you. [...] The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because
</p>
<p>he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has
</p>
<p>recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten. He sees
</p>
<p>the whole subject, by now, in a different light that he cannot conceive
</p>
<p>what is really troubling the pupil; he sees a dozen other difficulties
</p>
<p>which ought to be troubling him but aren&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>While most readers liked the student-friendly spirit of the first edi-
</p>
<p>tion, it was, of course, not perfect. Several readers pointed out typos
</p>
<p>and paragraphs with confusing notation or explanations. This feed-
</p>
<p>back guided me during the preparation of this second edition. I
</p>
<p>focused on correcting typos, improving the notation and I rewrote
</p>
<p>entire sections that were causing confusion.
</p>
<p>I hope these changes make "Physics from Symmetry" even more
</p>
<p>student-friendly and useful3.3 No book is ever perfect and I&rsquo;m al-
ways happy to receive feedback. So if
you find an error, have an idea for im-
provement or simply want to comment

<p>Preface to the First Edition
</p>
<p>The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all
</p>
<p>comprehensible.
</p>
<p>- Albert Einstein4 4 As quoted in Jon Fripp, Deborah
Fripp, and Michael Fripp. Speaking of
Science. Newnes, 1st edition, 4 2000.
ISBN 9781878707512In the course of studying physics I became, like any student of
</p>
<p>physics, familiar with many fundamental equations and their solu-
</p>
<p>tions, but I wasn&rsquo;t really able to see their connection.
</p>
<p>I was thrilled when I understood that most of them have a com-
</p>
<p>mon origin: symmetry. To me, the most beautiful thing in physics is
</p>
<p>when something incomprehensible, suddenly becomes comprehen-
</p>
<p>sible, because of a deep explanation. That&rsquo;s why I fell in love with
</p>
<p>symmetries.
</p>
<p>For example, for quite some time I couldn&rsquo;t really understand
</p>
<p>spin, which is some kind of curious internal angular momentum that
</p>
<p>almost all fundamental particles carry. Then I learned that spin is
</p>
<p>a direct consequence of a symmetry, called Lorentz symmetry, and
</p>
<p>everything started to make sense.
</p>
<p>Experiences like this were the motivation for this book and in
</p>
<p>some sense, I wrote the book I wished had existed when I started my
</p>
<p>journey in physics. Symmetries are beautiful explanations for many
</p>
<p>otherwise incomprehensible physical phenomena and this book is
</p>
<p>based on the idea that we can derive the fundamental theories of
</p>
<p>physics from symmetry.
</p>
<p>One could say that this book&rsquo;s approach to physics starts at the
</p>
<p>end: Before we even talk about classical mechanics or non-relativistic
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics, we will use the (as far as we know) exact sym-
</p>
<p>metries of nature to derive the fundamental equations of quantum
</p>
<p>field theory. Despite its unconventional approach, this book is about
</p>
<p>standard physics. We will not talk about speculative, experimentally
</p>
<p>unverified theories. We are going to use standard assumptions and
</p>
<p>develop standard theories.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>XII
</p>
<p>Depending on the reader&rsquo;s experience in physics, the book can be
</p>
<p>used in two different ways:
</p>
<p>&bull; It can be used as a quick primer for those who are relatively new
</p>
<p>to physics. The starting points for classical mechanics, electro-
</p>
<p>dynamics, quantum mechanics, special relativity and quantum
</p>
<p>field theory are explained and after reading, the reader can decide
</p>
<p>which topics are worth studying in more detail. There are many
</p>
<p>good books that cover every topic mentioned here in greater depth
</p>
<p>and at the end of each chapter some further reading recommen-
</p>
<p>dations are listed. If you feel you fit into this category, you are
</p>
<p>encouraged to start with the mathematical appendices at the end
</p>
<p>of the book5 before going any further.5 Starting with Chapter A. In addition,
the corresponding appendix chapters
are mentioned when a new mathemati-
cal concept is used in the text.
</p>
<p>&bull; Alternatively, this book can be used to connect loose ends for more
</p>
<p>experienced students. Many things that may seem arbitrary or a
</p>
<p>little wild when learnt for the first time using the usual historical
</p>
<p>approach, can be seen as being inevitable and straightforward
</p>
<p>when studied from the symmetry point of view.
</p>
<p>In any case, you are encouraged to read this book from cover to
</p>
<p>cover, because the chapters build on one another.
</p>
<p>We start with a short chapter about special relativity, which is the
</p>
<p>foundation for everything that follows. We will see that one of the
</p>
<p>most powerful constraints is that our theories must respect special
</p>
<p>relativity. The second part develops the mathematics required to
</p>
<p>utilize symmetry ideas in a physical context. Most of these mathe-
</p>
<p>matical tools come from a branch of mathematics called group theory.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Lagrangian formalism is introduced, which makes
</p>
<p>working with symmetries in a physical context straightforward. In
</p>
<p>the fifth and sixth chapters the basic equations of modern physics
</p>
<p>are derived using the two tools introduced earlier: The Lagrangian
</p>
<p>formalism and group theory. In the final part of this book these equa-
</p>
<p>tions are put into action. Considering a particle theory we end up
</p>
<p>with quantum mechanics, considering a field theory we end up with
</p>
<p>quantum field theory. Then we look at the non-relativistic and classi-
</p>
<p>cal limits of these theories, which leads us to classical mechanics and
</p>
<p>electrodynamics.
</p>
<p>Every chapter begins with a brief summary of the chapter. If you
</p>
<p>catch yourself thinking: "Why exactly are we doing this?", return
</p>
<p>to the summary at the beginning of the chapter and take a look at
</p>
<p>how this specific step fits into the bigger picture of the chapter. Every
</p>
<p>page has a big margin, so you can scribble down your own notes and
</p>
<p>ideas while reading6.6 On many pages I included in the
margin some further information or
pictures.</p>

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>1.1 What we Cannot Derive
</p>
<p>Before we talk about what we can derive from symmetry, let&rsquo;s clarify
</p>
<p>what we need to put into the theories by hand. First of all, there is
</p>
<p>presently no theory that is able to derive the constants of nature.
</p>
<p>These constants need to be extracted from experiments. Examples are
</p>
<p>the coupling constants of the various interactions and the masses of
</p>
<p>the elementary particles.
</p>
<p>Besides that, there is something else we cannot explain: The num-
</p>
<p>ber three. This should not be some kind of number mysticism, but
</p>
<p>we cannot explain all sorts of restrictions that are directly connected
</p>
<p>with the number three. For instance,
</p>
<p>&bull; there are three gauge theories1, corresponding to the three fun- 1 Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t understand
some terms, like gauge theory or
double cover, in this introduction. All
these terms will be explained in great
detail later in this book and they are
included here only for completeness.
</p>
<p>damental forces described by the standard model: The electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic, the weak and the strong force. These forces are de-
</p>
<p>scribed by gauge theories that correspond to the symmetry groups
</p>
<p>U(1), SU(2) and SU(3). Why is there no fundamental force follow-
</p>
<p>ing from SU(4)? Nobody knows!
</p>
<p>&bull; There are three lepton generations and three quark generations.
</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t there a fourth? We only know from experiments with
</p>
<p>high accuracy that there is no fourth generation2. 2 For example, the element abundance
in the present universe depends on the
number of generations. In addition,
there are strong evidence from collider
experiments. (See e.g. Phys. Rev. Lett.
109, 241802) .
</p>
<p>&bull; We only include the three lowest orders in Φ in the Lagrangian
</p>
<p>(Φ0,Φ1,Φ2), where Φ denotes here something generic that de-
</p>
<p>scribes our physical system and the Lagrangian is the object we
</p>
<p>use to derive our theory from, in order to get a sensible theory
</p>
<p>describing free (=non-interacting) fields/particles.
</p>
<p>&bull; We only use the three lowest-dimensional representations of the
</p>
<p>double cover of the Poincar&eacute; group, which correspond to spin 0, 12

<p>4 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>and 1, respectively, to describe fundamental particles. There is no
</p>
<p>fundamental particle with spin 32 .
</p>
<p>In the present theory, these things are assumptions we have to
</p>
<p>put in by hand. We know that they are correct from experiments,
</p>
<p>but there is presently no deeper principle why we have to stop after
</p>
<p>three.
</p>
<p>In addition, there is one thing that can&rsquo;t be derived from symme-
</p>
<p>try, but which must be taken into account in order to get a sensible
</p>
<p>theory:
</p>
<p>We are only allowed to include the lowest-possible, non-trivial order
</p>
<p>in the differential operator &part;μ in the Lagrangian. For some theories
</p>
<p>these are first order derivatives &part;μ, for other theories Lorentz in-
</p>
<p>variance forbids first order derivatives and therefore second order
</p>
<p>derivatives &part;μ&part;
μ are the lowest-possible, non-trivial order. Otherwise,
</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t get a sensible theory. Theories with higher order derivatives
</p>
<p>are unbounded from below, which means that the energy in such the-
</p>
<p>ories can be arbitrarily negative. Therefore states in such theories can
</p>
<p>always transition into lower energy states and are never stable.
</p>
<p>Finally, there is another thing we cannot derive in the way we de-
</p>
<p>rive the other theories in this book: gravity. Of course there is a beau-
</p>
<p>tiful and correct theory of gravity, called general relativity. But this
</p>
<p>theory works quite differently than the other theories and a complete
</p>
<p>derivation lies beyond the scope of this book. Quantum gravity, as an
</p>
<p>attempt to fit gravity into the same scheme as the other theories, is
</p>
<p>still a theory under construction that no one has successfully derived.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some comments regarding gravity will be made in the
</p>
<p>last chapter.</p>

<p>This book uses natural units, which means we set the Planck
</p>
<p>constant to h̄ = 1 and the speed of light to c = 1. This is helpful
</p>
<p>for theoretical considerations, because it avoids a lot of unnecessary
</p>
<p>writing. For applications the constants need to be added again to
</p>
<p>return to standard SI units.
</p>
<p>Our starting point will be the basic assumptions of special relativ-
</p>
<p>ity. These are: The velocity of light has the same value c in all inertial
</p>
<p>frames of reference, which are frames moving with constant velocity
</p>
<p>relative to each other and physics is the same in all inertial frames of
</p>
<p>reference.
</p>
<p>The set of all transformations permitted by these symmetry con-
</p>
<p>straints is called the Poincar&eacute; group. To be able to utilize them, we
</p>
<p>discuss the mathematical theory that enables us to work with sym-
</p>
<p>metries. This branch of mathematics is called group theory. We will
</p>
<p>derive the irreducible representations of the Poincar&eacute; group3, which 3 To be technically correct: We will
derive the representations of the
double-cover of the Poincar&eacute; group
instead of the Poincar&eacute; group itself. The
term "double-cover" comes from the
observation that the map between the
double-cover of a group and the group
itself maps two elements of the double
cover to one element of the group. This
is explained in Section 3.3.1 in detail.
</p>
<p>you can think of as basic building blocks of all other representations.
</p>
<p>These representations are what we use later in this text to describe
</p>
<p>particles and fields of different spin. On the one hand, spin is an ab-
</p>
<p>stract label for different kinds of particles/fields and on the other
</p>
<p>hand can be seen as something like internal angular momentum. We
</p>
<p>will discuss in detail how this comes about.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Lagrangian formalism is introduced, which
</p>
<p>makes working with symmetries in a physical context very conve-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>nient. The central object is the Lagrangian. Different Lagrangians
</p>
<p>describe different physical systems and we will derive several La-
</p>
<p>grangians using symmetry considerations. In addition, the Euler-
</p>
<p>Lagrange equations are derived. These enable us to derive the equa-
</p>
<p>tions of motion from a given Lagrangian. Using the irreducible rep-
</p>
<p>resentations of the Poincar&eacute; group, the fundamental equations of
</p>
<p>motion for fields and particles with different spin can be derived.
</p>
<p>The central idea here is that the Lagrangian must be invariant
</p>
<p>(=does not change) under any transformation of the Poincar&eacute; group.
</p>
<p>This makes sure the equations of motion take the same form in all
</p>
<p>frames of reference, which we stated above as "physics is the same in
</p>
<p>all inertial frames".
</p>
<p>Then, we will discover another symmetry of the Lagrangian for
</p>
<p>free spin 12 fields: Invariance under U(1) transformations. Similarly
</p>
<p>an internal symmetry for spin 1 fields can be found. Demanding
</p>
<p>local U(1) symmetry will lead us to coupling terms between spin 12
and spin 1 fields. The Lagrangian with this coupling term is the cor-
</p>
<p>rect Lagrangian for quantum electrodynamics. A similar procedure
</p>
<p>for local SU(2) and SU(3) transformations will lead us to the correct
</p>
<p>Lagrangian for weak and strong interactions.
</p>
<p>In addition, we discuss symmetry breaking and a special way to
</p>
<p>break symmetries called the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs mecha-
</p>
<p>nism enables us to describe particles with mass4.4 Without the Higgs mechanism, terms
describing mass in the Lagrangian
spoil the symmetry and are therefore
forbidden.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, Noether&rsquo;s theorem is derived, which reveals a deep
</p>
<p>connection between symmetries and conserved quantities. We will
</p>
<p>utilize this connection by identifying each physical quantity with
</p>
<p>the corresponding symmetry generator. This leads us to the most
</p>
<p>important equation of quantum mechanics
</p>
<p>[x̂i, p̂j] = iδij (1.1)
</p>
<p>and quantum field theory
</p>
<p>[Φ̂(x), π̂(y)] = iδ(x &minus; y). (1.2)
</p>
<p>We continue by taking the non-relativistic5 limit of the equation5 Non-relativistic means that everything
moves slowly compared to the speed of
light and therefore especially curious
features of special relativity are too
small to be measurable.
</p>
<p>of motion for spin 0 particles, called Klein-Gordon equation, which
</p>
<p>result in the famous Schr&ouml;dinger equation. This, together with the
</p>
<p>identifications we made between physical quantities and the genera-
</p>
<p>tors of the corresponding symmetries, is the foundation of quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics.
</p>
<p>Then we take a look at free quantum field theory, by starting</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>introduction 7
</p>
<p>with the solutions of the different equations of motion6 and Eq. 1.2. 6 The Klein-Gordon, Dirac, Proka and
Maxwell equations.Afterwards, we take interactions into account, by taking a closer look
</p>
<p>at the Lagrangians with coupling terms between fields of different
</p>
<p>spin. This enables us to discuss how the probability amplitude for
</p>
<p>scattering processes can be derived.
</p>
<p>By deriving the Ehrenfest theorem the connection between quan-
</p>
<p>tum and classical mechanics is revealed. Furthermore, the fun-
</p>
<p>damental equations of classical electrodynamics, including the
</p>
<p>Maxwell equations and the Lorentz force law, are derived.
</p>
<p>Finally, the basic structure of the modern theory of gravity, called
</p>
<p>general relativity, is briefly introduced and some remarks regarding
</p>
<p>the difficulties in the derivation of a quantum theory of gravity are
</p>
<p>made.
</p>
<p>The major part of this book is about the tools we need to work
</p>
<p>with symmetries mathematically and about the derivation of what is
</p>
<p>commonly known as the standard model. The standard model uses
</p>
<p>quantum field theory to describe the behavior of all known elemen-
</p>
<p>tary particles. Until the present day, all experimental predictions of
</p>
<p>the standard model have been correct. Every other theory introduced
</p>
<p>here can then be seen to follow from the standard model as a special
</p>
<p>case. For example in the limit of macroscopic objects we get classical
</p>
<p>mechanics or in the limit of elementary particles with low energy,
</p>
<p>we get quantum mechanics. For those readers who have never heard
</p>
<p>about the presently-known elementary particles and their interac-
</p>
<p>tions, a really quick overview is included in the next section.
</p>
<p>1.3 Elementary Particles and Fundamental Forces
</p>
<p>There are two major categories for elementary particles: bosons and
</p>
<p>fermions. There can be never two fermions in exactly the same state,
</p>
<p>which is known as Pauli&rsquo;s exclusion principle, but infinitely many
</p>
<p>bosons. This curious fact of nature leads to the completely different
</p>
<p>behavior of these particles:
</p>
<p>&bull; fermions are responsible for matter
</p>
<p>&bull; bosons for the forces of nature.
</p>
<p>This means, for example, that atoms consist of fermions7, but the 7 Atoms consist of electrons, protons
and neutrons, which are all fermions.
But take note that protons and neutrons
are not fundamental and consist of
quarks, which are fermions, too.
</p>
<p>electromagnetic-force is mediated by bosons. The bosons that are
</p>
<p>responsible for electromagnetic interactions are called photons. One
</p>
<p>of the most dramatic consequences of thie exclusion principle is that
</p>
<p>there is stable matter at all. If there could be infinitely many fermions
</p>

<p>8 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>There are four presently known fundamental forces
</p>
<p>&bull; The electromagnetic force, which is mediated by massless photons.
</p>
<p>&bull; The weak force, which is mediated by massive W+,W&minus; and Z-
bosons.
</p>
<p>&bull; The strong force, which is mediated by massless gluons.
</p>
<p>&bull; Gravity, which is (maybe) mediated by gravitons.
</p>
<p>Some of the these bosons are massless and some are not and this
</p>
<p>tells us something deep about nature. We will fully understand this
</p>
<p>after setting up the appropriate framework. For the moment, just
</p>
<p>take note that each force is closely related to a symmetry. The fact
</p>
<p>that the bosons mediating the weak force are massive means the
</p>
<p>related symmetry is broken. This process of spontaneous symmetry
</p>
<p>breaking is responsible for the masses of all elementary particles.
</p>
<p>We will see later that this is possible through the coupling to another
</p>
<p>fundamental boson, the Higgs boson.
</p>
<p>Fundamental particles interact via some force if they carry the
</p>
<p>corresponding charge9.9 All charges have a beautiful common
origin that will be discussed in Chapter
7. &bull; For the electromagnetic force this is the electric charge and conse-
</p>
<p>quently only electrically charged particles take part in electromag-
</p>
<p>netic interactions.
</p>
<p>&bull; For the weak force, the charge is called isospin10. All known10 Often the charge of the weak force
carries the extra prefix "weak", i.e. is
called weak isospin, because there
is another concept called isospin for
composite objects that interact via the
strong force. Nevertheless, this is not a
fundamental charge and in this book
the prefix "weak" is omitted.
</p>
<p>fermions carry isospin and therefore interact via the weak force.
</p>
<p>&bull; The charge of the strong force is called color, because of some
</p>
<p>curious features it shares with the humanly visible colors. Don&rsquo;t
</p>
<p>let this name confuse you, because this charge has nothing to do
</p>
<p>with the colors you see in everyday life.
</p>
<p>The fundamental fermions are divided into two subcategories:
</p>
<p>quarks, which are the building blocks of protons and neutrons, and
</p>
<p>leptons. Famous leptons are, for example, electrons and neutrinos.
</p>
<p>The difference is that quarks carry color charge and therefore take
</p>
<p>part in strong interactions, whereas leptons do not. There are three
</p>
<p>quark and lepton generations, which consist each of two particles:
</p>
<p>Generation 1 Generation 2 Generation 3 Electric charge Isospin Color

<p>introduction 9
</p>
<p>Different particles can be identified through labels. In addition
</p>
<p>to the charges and the mass there is another incredibly important
</p>
<p>label called spin, which can be seen as some kind of internal angular
</p>
<p>momentum. Bosons carry integer spin, whereas fermions carry half-
</p>
<p>integer spin. The fundamental fermions we listed above have spin
1
2 and almost all fundamental bosons have spin 1. There is only one
</p>
<p>known fundamental particle with spin 0: the Higgs boson.
</p>
<p>There is an anti-particle for each particle, which carries exactly the
</p>
<p>same labels with opposite sign11. For the electron the anti-particle 11 Maybe except for the mass label.
This is currently under experimental
investigation, for example at the AEGIS,
the ATRAP and the ALPHA exper-
iment, located at CERN in Geneva,
Switzerland.
</p>
<p>is called positron, but in general there is no extra name and only a
</p>
<p>prefix "anti". For example, the antiparticle corresponding to an up-
</p>
<p>quark is called anti-up-quark. Some particles, like the photon12 are
</p>
<p>12 And maybe the neutrinos, which is
currently under experimental investi-
gation in many experiments that search
for a neutrinoless double-beta decay.
</p>
<p>their own anti-particle.
</p>
<p>All these notions will be explained in more detail later in this text.
</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to start with the derivation of the theory that describes
</p>
<p>correctly the interplay of the different characters in this particle zoo.
</p>
<p>The first cornerstone towards this goal is Einstein&rsquo;s famous theory of
</p>
<p>special relativity, which is the topic of the next chapter.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2
</p>
<p>Special Relativity
</p>
<p>The famous Michelson-Morley experiment discovered that the speed
</p>
<p>of light has the same value in all reference frames1. Albert Einstein 1 The speed of objects we observe in
everyday life depend on the frame
of reference. For example, when an
observer standing at a train station
measures that a train moves with
50 kmh , another observer running with
</p>
<p>15 kmh next to the same train, measures
</p>
<p>that the train moves with 35 kmh . In
contrast, light always moves with
1, 08 &middot; 109 kmh , no matter how you move
relative to it.
</p>
<p>recognized the far reaching consequences of this observation and
</p>
<p>around this curious fact of nature he built the theory of special rela-
</p>
<p>tivity. Starting from the constant speed of light, Einstein was able to
</p>
<p>predict many interesting and strange consequences that all proved
</p>
<p>to be true. We will see how powerful this idea is, but first let&rsquo;s clarify
</p>
<p>what special relativity is all about. The two basic postulates are
</p>
<p>&bull; The principle of relativity: Physics is the same in all inertial
</p>
<p>frames of reference, i.e. frames moving with constant velocity
</p>
<p>relative to each other.
</p>
<p>&bull; The invariance of the speed of light: The velocity of light has the
</p>
<p>same value c in all inertial frames of reference.
</p>
<p>In addition, we will assume that the stage our physical laws act on
</p>
<p>is homogeneous and isotropic. This means it does not matter where
</p>
<p>(=homogeneity) we perform an experiment and how it is oriented
</p>
<p>(=isotropy), the laws of physics stay the same. For example, if two
</p>
<p>physicists, one in New-York and the other one in Tokyo, perform ex-
</p>
<p>actly the same experiment, they would find the same2 physical laws. 2 Besides from changing constants,
as, for example, the gravitational
acceleration
</p>
<p>Equally a physicist on planet Mars would find the same physical
</p>
<p>laws.
</p>
<p>The laws of physics, formulated correctly, shouldn&rsquo;t change if
</p>
<p>you look at the experiment from a different perspective or repeat
</p>
<p>it tomorrow. In addition, the first postulate tells us that a physical
</p>
<p>experiment should come up with the same result regardless of if
</p>
<p>you perform it on a wagon moving with constant speed or at rest in
</p>
<p>a laboratory. These things coincide with everyday experience. For
</p>
<p>example, if you close your eyes in a car moving with constant speed,
</p>
<p>there is no way to tell if you are really moving or if you&rsquo;re at rest.

<p>12 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Without homogeneity and isotropy physics would be in deep
</p>
<p>trouble: If the laws of nature we deduce from experiment would hold
</p>
<p>only at one point in space, for a specific orientation of the experiment
</p>
<p>such laws would be rather useless.
</p>
<p>The only unintuitive thing is the second postulate, which is con-
</p>
<p>trary to all everyday experience. Nevertheless, all experiments until
</p>
<p>the present day show that it is correct.
</p>
<p>2.1 The Invariant of Special Relativity
</p>
<p>Before we dive into the details, here&rsquo;s a short summary of what we
</p>
<p>want to do in the following sections. We use the postulates of special
</p>
<p>relativity to derive the Minkowski metric, which tells us how to com-
</p>
<p>pute the "distance" between two physical events. Another name for
</p>
<p>physical events in this context is points in Minkowski space, which
</p>
<p>is how the stage the laws of special relativity act on is called. It then
</p>
<p>follows that all transformations connecting different inertial frames of
</p>
<p>reference must leave the Minkowski metric unchanged. This is how
</p>
<p>we are able to find all transformations that connect allowed frames
</p>
<p>of reference, i.e. frames with a constant speed of light. In the rest of
</p>
<p>the book we will use the knowledge of these transformations, to find
</p>
<p>equations that are unchanged by these transformations. Let&rsquo;s start
</p>
<p>with a thought experiment that enables us to derive one of the most
</p>
<p>fundamental consequences of the postulates of special relativity.
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.1: Illustration of the thought
experiment
</p>
<p>Imagine, we have a spectator, standing at the origin of his co-
</p>
<p>ordinate system and sending a light pulse straight up, where it is
</p>
<p>reflected by a mirror and finally reaches again the point from where
</p>
<p>it was sent. An illustration of this can be seen in Fig. 2.1
</p>
<p>We have three important events:
</p>
<p>&bull; A : the light leaves the starting point
</p>
<p>&bull; B : the light is reflected at a mirror
</p>
<p>&bull; C : the light returns to the starting point.
</p>
<p>The time-interval between A and C is33 For constant speed v we have v = ∆s
∆t ,
</p>
<p>with the distance covered ∆s and the
time needed ∆t, and therefore ∆t = ∆sv ∆t = tC &minus; tA =
</p>
<p>2L
</p>
<p>c
, (2.1)
</p>
<p>where L denotes the distance between the starting point and the
</p>
<p>mirror.
</p>
<p>Next imagine a second spectator, standing at tA at the origin of his
</p>
<p>coordinate system and moving with constant velocity u to the left,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>special relativity 13
</p>
<p>relative to the first spectator4. For simplicity let&rsquo;s assume that the 4 Transformations that allow us to trans-
form the description of one observer
into the description of a second ob-
server, moving with constant speed
relative to first observer, are called
boosts. We derive later a formal de-
scription of such transformations.
</p>
<p>origin of this second spectators&rsquo; coordinate system coincides at tA
with the coordinate origin of the first spectator. The second spectator
</p>
<p>sees things a little differently. In his frame of reference the point
</p>
<p>where the light ends up will not have the same coordinates as the
</p>
<p>starting point (see Fig. 2.2).
</p>
<p>We can express this mathematically
</p>
<p>x&prime;A = 0 �= x&prime;C = u∆t&prime; &rarr; ∆x&prime; = u∆t&prime;, (2.2)
</p>
<p>where the primed coordinates denote the moving spectator. For the
</p>
<p>first spectator in the rest-frame we have of course
</p>
<p>xA = xC &rarr; ∆x = 0. (2.3)
</p>
<p>We assume movement along the x-axis, therefore
</p>
<p>y&prime;A = y
&prime;
C and z
</p>
<p>&prime;
A = z
</p>
<p>&prime;
C &rarr; ∆y&prime; = 0 and ∆z&prime; = 0
</p>
<p>(2.4)
</p>
<p>and equally of course
</p>
<p>yA = yC and zA = zC &rarr; ∆y = 0 and ∆z = 0.
(2.5)
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.2: Illustration of the thought
experiment for a moving spectator. The
second spectator moves to the left and
therefore the first spectator (and the
experiment) moves relative to him to
the right.
</p>
<p>The next question is: What about the time interval the second
</p>
<p>spectator measures? Because we postulate a constant velocity of
</p>
<p>light, the second spectator measures a different time interval between
</p>
<p>A and C! The time interval ∆t&prime; = t&prime;C &minus; t&prime;A is equal to the distance l the
light travels, as the second spectator observes it, divided by the speed
</p>
<p>of light c.
</p>
<p>∆t&prime; =
l
</p>
<p>c
(2.6)
</p>
<p>We can compute the distance traveled l using the good old Pythagorean
</p>
<p>theorem (see Fig. 2.2)
</p>
<p>l = 2

<p>&radic;(
1
</p>
<p>2
u∆t&prime;
</p>
<p>)2
+ L2. (2.7)
</p>
<p>Using Eq. 2.6, we therefore conclude
</p>
<p>c∆t&prime; = 2
</p>
<p>&radic;(
1
</p>
<p>2
u∆t&prime;
</p>
<p>)2
+ L2 . (2.8)
</p>
<p>If we now use ∆x&prime; = u∆t&prime; from Eq. 2.2, we can write
</p>
<p>c∆t&prime; = 2
</p>
<p>&radic;(

</p>
<p>. (2.10)
</p>
<p>So finally, we arrive5 at5 Take note that what we are doing here
is just the shortest path to the result,
because we chose the origins of the
two coordinate systems to coincide
at tA. Nevertheless, the same can be
done, with more effort, for arbitrary
choices, because physics is the same
in all inertial frames. We used this
freedom to choose two inertial frames
where the computation is easy. In
an arbitrarily moving second inertial
system we do not have ∆y&prime; = 0 and
∆z&prime; = 0. Nevertheless, the equation
holds, because physics is the same in all
inertial frames.

<p>.
</p>
<p>(2.11)
</p>
<p>Considering a third observer, moving with a different velocity rela-
</p>
<p>tive to the first observer, we can use the same reasoning to arrive at
</p>
<p>(c∆t&prime;&prime;)2 &minus; (∆x&prime;&prime;)2 &minus; (∆y&prime;&prime;)2 &minus; (∆z&prime;&prime;)2 = (c∆t)2 &minus; (∆x)2 &minus; (∆y)2 &minus; (∆z)2
(2.12)
</p>
<p>Therefore, we have found something which is the same for all
</p>
<p>observers: the quadratic form
</p>
<p>(∆s)2 &equiv; (c∆t)2 &minus; (∆x)2 &minus; (∆y)2 &minus; (∆z)2. (2.13)
</p>
<p>In addition, we learned in this section that (∆x)2 + (∆y)2 + (∆z)2
</p>
<p>or (c∆t)2 aren&rsquo;t the same for different observers. We will talk about
</p>
<p>the implications of this curious property in the next section.
</p>
<p>2.2 Proper Time
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.3: World line of an object at rest.
The position of the object stays the
same as time goes on.
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.4: World line of a moving object
with two events A and B. The distance
travelled between A and B is ∆x and
the time that passed the events is ∆t.
</p>
<p>We derived in the last section the invariant of special relativity ∆s2,
</p>
<p>i.e. a quantity that has the same value for all observers. Now, we
</p>
<p>want to think about the physical meaning of this quantity.
</p>
<p>For brevity, let&rsquo;s restrict ourselves to one spatial dimension. An
</p>
<p>object at rest, relative to some observer, has a spacetime diagram
</p>
<p>as drawn in Fig. 2.3. In contrast, an object moving with constant
</p>
<p>velocity, relative to the same observer, has a spacetime diagram as
</p>
<p>drawn in Fig. 2.4.
</p>
<p>The lines we draw to specify the position of objects in spacetime
</p>
<p>are called world lines. World lines are always observer dependent.
</p>
<p>Two different observers may draw completely different world lines
</p>
<p>for the same object. The moving object with world line drawn in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>special relativity 15
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.4, looks for a second observer who moves with the same con-
</p>
<p>stant speed as the object, as drawn in Fig. 2.5. For this second ob-
</p>
<p>server the object is at rest. Take note, to account for the two different
</p>
<p>descriptions we introduce primed coordinates for the second ob-
</p>
<p>server: x&prime; and t&prime;.
</p>
<p>We can see that both observers do not agree on the distance the
</p>
<p>object travels between some events A and B in spacetime. For the
</p>
<p>first observer we have ∆x �= 0, but for the second observer ∆x&prime; = 0.
For both observers the time interval between A and B is non-zero:
</p>
<p>∆t �= 0 and ∆t&prime; �= 0. Both observers agree on the value of the quantity
(∆s)2, because as we derived in the last section, this invariant of
</p>
<p>special relativity has the same value for all observers. A surprising
</p>
<p>consequence is that both observers do not agree on the time elapsed
</p>
<p>between the events A and B
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.5: World line of the same moving
object, as observed from someone
moving with the same constant speed
as the object. The distance travelled
between A and B is for this observer
∆x&prime; = 0.
</p>
<p>(∆s)2 = (c∆t)2 &minus; (∆x)2 (2.14)
</p>
<p>(∆s&prime;)2 = (c∆t&prime;)2 &minus; (∆x&prime;)2︸ ︷︷ ︸
=0
</p>
<p>= (c∆t&prime;)2 (2.15)
</p>
<p>(∆s)2 = (∆s&prime;)2 &rarr; (∆t&prime;)2 �= (∆t)2 because (∆x)2 �= 0 . (2.16)
</p>
<p>This is one of the most famous phenomena of special relativity
</p>
<p>and commonly called time-dilation. Time-intervals and spatial dis-
</p>
<p>tances are observer dependent. The clocks tick differently for differ-
</p>
<p>ent observers and therefore they observe a different number of ticks
</p>
<p>between two events.
</p>
<p>Now that the concept of time has become relative, a new notion of
</p>
<p>time that all observers agree on may be useful. In the example above
</p>
<p>we can see that for the second observer, moving with the same speed
</p>
<p>as the object, we have
</p>
<p>(∆s)2 = (c∆t&prime;)2 . (2.17)
</p>
<p>This means the invariant of special relativity is equivalent, up to a
</p>
<p>constant c, to the time interval measured by this observer. With this
</p>
<p>in mind, we can interpret (∆s)2 and define a notion of time that all
</p>
<p>observers agree on. We define
</p>
<p>(∆s)2 = (c∆τ)2, (2.18)
</p>
<p>where τ is called the proper time. The proper time is the time mea-
</p>
<p>sured by an observer in the special frame of reference where the
</p>
<p>object in question is at rest.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Of course objects in the real world aren&rsquo;t restricted to motion
</p>
<p>with constant speed, but if the time interval is short enough, in the
</p>
<p>extremal case infinitesimal, any motion is linear and the notion of
</p>
<p>proper time is sensible. In mathematical terms this requires we make
</p>
<p>the transition to infinitesimal intervals ∆ &rarr; d:
</p>
<p>(ds)2 = (cdτ)2 = (cdt)2 &minus; (dx)2 &minus; (dy)2 &minus; (dz)2. (2.19)
</p>
<p>Therefore, even if an object moves wildly, we can still imagine
</p>
<p>some observer with a clock travelling with the object and therefore
</p>
<p>observing the object at rest. The time interval this special observer
</p>
<p>measures is the proper time and all observers agree on its value, be-
</p>
<p>cause (ds)2 = (cdτ)2 has the same value for all observers. Again,
</p>
<p>this does not mean that all observers measure the same time inter-
</p>
<p>val! They just agree on the value of the time interval measured by
</p>
<p>someone who travels with the object in question.
</p>
<p>2.3 Upper Speed Limit
</p>
<p>Now that we have an interpretation for the invariant of special rela-
</p>
<p>tivity, we can go a step further and explore one of the most stunning
</p>
<p>consequences of the postulates of special relativity.
</p>
<p>It follows from the minus sign in the definition of ∆s2that it can be
</p>
<p>zero for two events that are separated in space and time. It even can
</p>
<p>be negative, but then we would get a complex value for the proper
</p>
<p>time6, which is commonly discarded as unphysical. We conclude, we6 Recall (ds)2 = (cdτ)2 and therefore if
(ds)2 &lt; 0 &rarr; dτ is complex. have a minimal proper time τ = 0 for two events if ∆s2 = 0. Then we
</p>
<p>can write
</p>
<p>∆s2min = 0 = (c∆t)
2 &minus; (∆x)2 &minus; (∆y)2 &minus; (∆z)2
</p>
<p>&rarr; (c∆t)2 = (∆x)2 + (∆y)2 + (∆z)2
</p>
<p>&rarr; c2 = (∆x)
2 + (∆y)2 + (∆z)2
</p>
<p>(∆t)2
. (2.20)
</p>
<p>On the right-hand side we have a squared velocity v2, i.e. distance
</p>
<p>divided by time. We can rewrite this in the infinitesimal limit
</p>
<p>&rarr; c2 = (dx)
2 + (dy)2 + (dz)2
</p>
<p>(dt)2
. (2.21)
</p>
<p>The functions x(t), y(t), z(t) describe the path between the two
</p>
<p>events. Therefore, we have on the right-hand side the velocity be-
</p>
<p>tween the events.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>special relativity 17
</p>
<p>We conclude the lowest value for the proper time is measured by
</p>
<p>someone travelling with speed
</p>
<p>&rarr; c2 = v2. (2.22)
</p>
<p>This means nothing can move with a velocity larger than c! We
</p>
<p>have an upper speed limit for everything in physics. Two events
</p>
<p>in spacetime can&rsquo;t be connected by anything faster than c.
</p>
<p>From this observation follows the principle of locality, which
</p>
<p>means that everything in physics can only be influenced by its imme-
</p>
<p>diate surroundings. Every interaction must be local and there can be
</p>
<p>no action at a distance, because everything in physics needs time to
</p>
<p>travel from some point to another.
</p>
<p>2.4 The Minkowski Notation

<p>- Hermann Minkowski7 7 In a speech at the 80th Assembly
of German Natural Scientists and
Physicians (21 September 1908)We can rewrite the invariant of special relativity
</p>
<p>ds2 = (cdt)2 &minus; (dx)2 &minus; (dy)2 &minus; (dz)2 (2.23)
</p>
<p>by using a new notation, which looks quite complicated at first sight,
</p>
<p>but will prove to be invaluable:
</p>
<p>ds2 = ημνdxμdxν = η
00(dx0)
</p>
<p>2 + η11(dx1)
2 + η22(dx2)
</p>
<p>2 + η33(dx3)

</p>
<p>= (dx0)
2 &minus; (dx1)2 &minus; (dx2)2 &minus; (dx3)2 = (cdt)2 &minus; (dx)2 &minus; (dy)2 &minus; (dz)2.
</p>
<p>(2.24)
</p>
<p>Here we use several new notations and conventions one needs to
</p>
<p>become familiar with, because they are used everywhere in modern
</p>
<p>physics:
</p>
<p>&bull; Einsteins summation convention: If an index occurs twice, a sum
</p>
<p>is implicitly assumed : &sum;3i=1 aibi = aibi = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3, but
</p>
<p>&sum;
3
i=1 aibj = a1bj + a2bj + a3bj �= aibj
</p>
<p>&bull; Greek indices8, like μ, ν or σ, are always summed from 0 to 3: 8 In contrast, Roman indices like i, j, k
are always summed: xixi &equiv; &sum;3i xixi
from 1 to 3. Much later in the book
we will use capital Roman letters like
A, B,C that are summed from 1 to 8.
</p>
<p>xμyμ = &sum;
3
μ=0 xμyμ.
</p>
<p>&bull; Renaming of the variables x0 &equiv; ct, x1 &equiv; x, x2 &equiv; y and x3 &equiv; z, to
make it obvious that time and space are now treated equally and

</p>
<p>In addition, it&rsquo;s conventional to introduce the notion of a four-
</p>
<p>vector
</p>
<p>dxμ =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
</p>
<p>dx0

</p>
<p>This is really just a clever way of writing things. A physical in-
</p>
<p>terpretation of ds is that it is the "distance" between two events in
</p>
<p>spacetime. Take note that we don&rsquo;t mean here only the spatial dis-
</p>
<p>tance, but also have to consider a separation in time. If we consider
</p>
<p>3-dimensional Euclidean10 space the squared (shortest) distance be-10 3-dimensional Euclidean space is just
the space of classical physics, where
time was treated differently from space
and therefore it was not included into
the geometric considerations. The
notion of spacetime, with time as a
fourth coordinate was introduced with
special relativity, which enables mixing
of time and space coordinates as we
will see.

</p>
<p>The mathematical tool that tells us the distance between two in-
</p>
<p>finitesimal separated points is called metric. In boring Euclidean
</p>
<p>space the metric is just the identity matrix δ. In the curved space-
</p>
<p>time of general relativity much more complicated metrics can occur.
</p>
<p>The geometry of the spacetime of special relativity is encoded in the
</p>
<p>relatively simple Minkowski metric η. Because the metric is the tool
</p>
<p>to compute length, we need it to define the length of a four-vector,
</p>
<p>which is given by the scalar product of the vector with itself1212 The same is true in Euclidean space:
length2(v) = �v &middot; �v = v21 + v22 + v23,
because the metric is here simply
</p>
<p>δ =
</p>
<p>⎛

0 1 0
0 0 1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎠.
</p>
<p>x2 = x &middot; x &equiv; xμxνημν .
</p>
<p>Analogously, the scalar product of two arbitrary four-vectors is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>special relativity 19
</p>
<p>defined by
</p>
<p>x &middot; y &equiv; xμyνημν. (2.28)
</p>
<p>There is another, notational convention to make computations
</p>
<p>more streamlined. We define a four-vector with upper index as13 13 Four-vectors with a lower index are
often called covariant and four-vectors
with an upper index contravariant.
</p>
<p>xμ &equiv; ημνxν (2.29)
</p>
<p>or equally
</p>
<p>yν &equiv; ημνyμ =︸︷︷︸
The Minkowski metric is symmetric ημν=ηνμ
</p>
<p>ηνμyμ . (2.30)
</p>
<p>Therefore, we can write the scalar product of two four-vectors as14 14 The name of the index makes no
difference. For more information about
this have a look at Appendix B.5.1.
</p>
<p>x &middot; y &equiv; xμyνημν = xμyμ = xνyν. (2.31)
</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which index we transform to an upper index. This
</p>
<p>is just a way of avoiding writing the Minkowski metric all the time,
</p>
<p>just as Einstein&rsquo;s summation convention is introduced to avoid writ-
</p>
<p>ing the summation sign.
</p>
<p>2.5 Lorentz Transformations
</p>
<p>Next, we try to figure out in what ways we can transform our de-
</p>
<p>scription in a given frame of reference without violating the postu-
</p>
<p>lates of special-relativity. We learned above that it follows directly
</p>
<p>from the two postulates that ds2 = ημνdxμdxν is the same in all iner-
</p>
<p>tial frames of reference:
</p>
<p>ds&prime;2 = dx&prime;μdx
&prime;
νη
</p>
<p>μν = ds2 = dxμdxνη
μν. (2.32)
</p>
<p>Therefore, allowed transformations are those which leave this quadratic
</p>
<p>form or equally the scalar product of Minkowski spacetime invariant.
</p>
<p>Denoting a generic transformation that transforms the description in
</p>
<p>one frame of reference into the description in another frame with Λ,
</p>
<p>the transformed coordinates dx&prime;μ can be written as:
</p>
<p>dxμ &rarr; dx&prime;μ = Λ σμ dxσ. (2.33)
</p>
<p>Then we can write the invariance condition as</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

<p>(ds)2 = (ds&prime;)2

</p>
<p>Or written in matrix notation1515 If you wonder about the transpose
here have a look at Appendix C.1.
</p>
<p>η = ΛTηΛ (2.35)
</p>
<p>This is the condition that transformations Λ between allowed
</p>
<p>frames of reference must fulfil.
</p>
<p>If this seems strange at this point don&rsquo;t worry, because we will see
</p>
<p>that such a condition is a quite natural thing. In the next chapter we
</p>
<p>will learn that, for example, rotations in ordinary Euclidean space are
</p>
<p>defined as those transformations O that leave the scalar product of
</p>
<p>Euclidean space invariant1616 The &middot; is used for the scalar product of
vectors, which corresponds to�a &middot;�b =
�aT�b for ordinary matrix multiplication,
where a vector is an 1&times; 3 matrix. The
fact (Oa)T = aTOT is explained in
Appendix C.1, specifically Eq. C.3.
</p>
<p>�a &middot;�b !=�a&prime; &middot;�b&prime; =︸︷︷︸
Take note that (Oa)T=aTOT
</p>
<p>�aTOTO�b. (2.36)
</p>
<p>Therefore17 OT1O
!
= 1 and we can see that the metric of Euclidean
</p>
<p>17 This condition is often called orthog-
onality, hence the symbol O. A matrix
satisfying OTO = 1 is called orthogonal,
because its columns are orthogonal
to each other. In other words: Each
column of a matrix can be thought of
as a vector and the orthogonality condi-
tion for matrices means that each such
vector is orthogonal to all other column
vectors.
</p>
<p>space, which is just the unit matrix 1, plays the same role as the
</p>
<p>Minkowski metric in Eq. 2.35. This is one part of the definition for
</p>
<p>rotations, because the defining feature of rotations is that they leave
</p>
<p>the length of a vector unchanged, which corresponds mathematically
</p>
<p>to the invariance of the scalar product18. Additionally we must in-
</p>
<p>18 Recall that the length of a vector is
given by the scalar product of a vector
with itself.
</p>
<p>clude that rotations do not change the orientation19 of our coordinate
</p>
<p>19 This is explained in Appendix A.5.
</p>
<p>system, which means mathematically detO
!
= 1, because there are
</p>
<p>other transformations which leave the length of any vector invariant:
</p>
<p>spatial inversions20
</p>
<p>20 A spatial inversion is simply a map
�x &rarr; &minus;�x. Mathematically such trans-
formations are characterized by the
</p>
<p>conditions detO
!
= &minus;1 and OTO = 1.
</p>
<p>Therefore, if we only want to talk about
rotations we have the extra condition
detO
</p>
<p>!
= 1. Another name for spatial
</p>
<p>inversions are parity transformations.
</p>
<p>We define the Lorentz transformations as those transformations
</p>
<p>that leave the scalar product of Minkowski spacetime invariant. In
</p>
<p>physical terms this means that Lorentz transformations describe
</p>
<p>changes between frames of references that respect the postulates
</p>
<p>of special relativity. In turn this does mean, of course, that every-
</p>
<p>time we want to get a term that does not change under Lorentz
</p>
<p>transformations, we must combine an upper with a lower index:</p>

</p>
<p>xμy
μ = xμyνημν. We will construct explicit matrices for the allowed
</p>
<p>transformations in the next chapter, after we have learned some very
</p>
<p>elegant techniques for dealing with conditions like this.
</p>
<p>2.6 Invariance, Symmetry and Covariance
</p>
<p>Before we move on, we have to talk about some very important no-
</p>
<p>tions. Firstly, we call something invariant, if it does not change under
</p>
<p>transformations. For instance, let&rsquo;s consider something arbitrary like
</p>
<p>F = F(A, B,C, ...) that depends on different quantities A, B,C, .... If
</p>
<p>we transform A, B,C, ... &rarr; A&prime;, B&prime;,C&prime;, ... and we have
</p>
<p>F(A&prime;, B&prime;,C&prime;, ...) = F(A, B,C, ...) (2.37)
</p>
<p>F is called invariant under this transformation. We can express this
</p>
<p>differently using the word symmetry. Symmetry is defined as in-
</p>
<p>variance under a transformation or class of transformations. For
</p>
<p>example, some physical system is symmetric under rotations if we
</p>
<p>can rotate it arbitrarily and it always stays exactly the same. Another
</p>
<p>example would be a room with constant temperature. The quantity
</p>
<p>temperature does not depend on the position of measurement. In
</p>
<p>other words, the quantity temperature is invariant under translations.
</p>
<p>A translation means that we move every point a given distance in a
</p>
<p>specified direction. Therefore, we have translational symmetry within
</p>
<p>this room.
</p>
<p>Covariance means something similar, but may not be confused
</p>
<p>with invariance. An equation is called covariant, if it takes the same
</p>
<p>form when the objects in it are transformed. For instance, if we have
</p>
<p>an equation
</p>
<p>E1 = aA
2 + bBA + cC4
</p>
<p>and after the transformation this equation reads
</p>
<p>E&prime;1 = aA
&prime;2 + bB&prime;A&prime; + cC&prime;4
</p>
<p>the equation is called covariant, because the form stayed the same.
</p>
<p>Another equation
</p>
<p>E2 = x
2 + 4axy + z
</p>
<p>that after a transformation looks like
</p>
<p>E&prime;2 = y
&prime;3 + 4az&prime;y&prime; + y&prime;2 + 8z&prime;x&prime;
</p>
<p>is not covariant, because it changed its form completely.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>All physical laws must be covariant under Lorentz transformations,
</p>
<p>because only such laws are valid in all reference frames. Formulat-
</p>
<p>ing the laws of physics in a non-covariant way would be a very bad
</p>
<p>idea, because such laws would only hold in one frame of reference.
</p>
<p>The laws of physics would look differently in Tokyo and New York.
</p>
<p>There is no preferred frame of reference and we therefore want our
</p>
<p>laws to hold in all reference frames. We will learn later how we can
</p>
<p>formulate the laws of physics in a covariant manner.</p>

Poincar&eacute; Group
</p>
<p>The final goal of this chapter is the derivation of the fundamental
</p>
<p>representations of the double cover of the Poincar&eacute; group, which
</p>
<p>we assume is the fundamental symmetry group of spacetime. These
</p>
<p>fundamental representations are the tools needed to describe all
</p>
<p>elementary particles, each representation for a different kind of el-
</p>
<p>ementary particle. The representations will tell us what types of
</p>
<p>elementary particles exist in nature.
</p>
<p>We start with the definition of a group, which is motivated by two
</p>
<p>easy examples. Then, as a first step towards Lie theory we introduce
</p>
<p>two ways for describing rotations in two dimensions:
</p>
<p>&bull; 2&times; 2 rotation matrix and
</p>
<p>&bull; unit complex numbers.
</p>
<p>Then we will try to find a similar second description of rotations in
</p>
<p>three dimensions. This leads us to an extremely important group,
</p>
<p>called1 SU(2). After that, we will learn about Lie algebras, which en-
</p>
<p>1 The S stands for special, which means
det(M) = 1. U stands for unitary:
M&dagger;M = 1 and the number 2 is used
because the group is defined in the first
place by 2&times; 2 matrices.
</p>
<p>able us to learn a lot about something difficult (a Lie group) by using
</p>
<p>something simpler (the corresponding Lie algebra). There are in gen-
</p>
<p>eral many groups with the same Lie algebra, but only one of them
</p>
<p>is truly fundamental. We will use this knowledge to reveal the true
</p>
<p>fundamental symmetry group of nature, which doubly covers the
</p>
<p>Poincar&eacute; group. We usually start with some known transformations,
</p>
<p>derive the Lie algebra and use this Lie algebra to get different repre-
</p>
<p>sentations of the symmetry transformations. This will enable us to
</p>
<p>see that the representation we started with is just one special case out
</p>
<p>of many. This knowledge can then be used to learn something fun-
</p>
<p>damental about the Lorentz group, which is an important part of the

<p>Poincar&eacute; group. We will see that the Lie algebra of the double cover
</p>
<p>of the Lorentz group consists of two copies of the SU(2) Lie algebra.
</p>
<p>Therefore, we can directly use everything we learned about SU(2).
</p>
<p>Finally, we include translations into the considerations, which leads
</p>
<p>us to the Poincar&eacute; group. The Poincar&eacute; group is the Lorentz group
</p>
<p>plus translations. At this point, we will have everything at hand to
</p>
<p>classify the fundamental representations of the double cover of the
</p>
<p>Poincar&eacute; group. We use these fundamental representations in later
</p>
<p>chapters to derive the fundamental laws of physics.
</p>
<p>3.1 Groups
</p>
<p>If we want to utilize the power of symmetry, we need a framework
</p>
<p>to deal with symmetries mathematically. The branch of mathematics
</p>
<p>that deals with symmetries is called group theory. A special branch
</p>
<p>of group theory that deals with continuous symmetries is Lie The-
</p>
<p>ory.
</p>
<p>Symmetry is defined as invariance under a set of of transforma-
</p>
<p>tions and therefore, one defines a group as a collection of transforma-
</p>
<p>tions. Let us get started with two easy examples to get a feel for what
</p>
<p>we want to do:
</p>
<p>1. A square is mathematically a set of points (for example, the four
</p>
<p>corner points are part of this set) and a symmetry of the square is
</p>
<p>a transformation that maps this set of points into itself.
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.1: Illustration of a square
</p>
<p>Examples of symmetries of the square are rotations about the
</p>
<p>origin by 90◦, 180◦, 270◦ or 0◦. These rotations map the square into
itself. This means they map every point of the set to a point that
</p>
<p>lies again in the set and one says the set is invariant under such
</p>
<p>transformations.
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.2: Illustration of a square, rotated
by 5◦
</p>
<p>Take note that not every rotation is a symmetry of the square.
</p>
<p>This becomes obvious when we focus on the corner points of the
</p>
<p>square. Transforming the set by a clockwise rotation by, say 5◦,
maps these points into points outside the original set that defines
</p>
<p>the square. For example, as shown in Figure 3.2, the corner point
</p>
<p>A is mapped to the point A&prime;, which is not found inside the set that
defined the square in the first place. Therefore a rotation by 5◦ is
not a symmetry of the square. Of course the rotated object is still
</p>
<p>a square, but a different square (=different set of points). Never-
</p>
<p>theless, a rotation by 90◦ is a symmetry of the square because the
point A is mapped to the point B, which lies again in the original
</p>
<p>set. This is shown in Fig. 3.3.</p>

<p>Fig. 3.3: Illustration of the square
rotated by 90◦
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another helpful perspective: Imagine you close your eyes
</p>
<p>for a moment, and someone transforms a square in front of you. If
</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tell after opening your eyes whether the person changed
</p>
<p>anything at all, then the transformation was a symmetry transfor-
</p>
<p>mation.
</p>
<p>The set of transformations that leave the square invariant is called
</p>
<p>a group. The transformation parameter, here the rotation angle,
</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take on arbitrary values and the group is called a discrete
</p>
<p>group.
</p>
<p>2. Another example is the set of transformations that leave the unit
</p>
<p>circle invariant. Again, the unit circle is defined as a set of points
</p>
<p>and a symmetry transformation is a map that maps this set into
</p>
<p>itself.
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.4: Illustration of the rotation of
the unit circle. For arbitrary rotations
about the origin, all rotated points lie
again in the initial set.
</p>
<p>The unit circle is invariant under all rotations about the origin,
</p>
<p>not just a few. In other words: the transformation parameter (the
</p>
<p>rotation angle) can take on arbitrary values, and the group is said
</p>
<p>to be a continuous group.
</p>
<p>We are, of course, not only interested in symmetries of geomet-
</p>
<p>ric shapes. For examples, considering vectors, we can look at the set
</p>
<p>of transformations that leave the length of any vector unchanged.
</p>
<p>For this reason, the definition of symmetry at the beginning of this
</p>
<p>chapter was very general: Symmetry means invariance under a trans-
</p>
<p>formation. Luckily, there is one mathematical theory, called group
</p>
<p>theory, that lets us work with all kinds of symmetries2 2 As a side-note: Group theory was
invented historically to describe sym-
metries of equationsTo make the idea of a mathematical theory that lets us deal with
</p>
<p>symmetries precise, we need to distill the defining features of sym-
</p>
<p>metries into mathematical terms:
</p>
<p>&bull; Leaving the object in question unchanged ("doing nothing") is
</p>
<p>always a symmetry and therefore, every group needs to contain an
</p>
<p>identity element. In the examples above, the identity element is the
</p>
<p>rotation by 0◦.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>&bull; Transforming something and afterwards doing the inverse trans-
</p>
<p>formation must be equivalent to doing nothing. Therefore, there
</p>
<p>must be, for every element in the set, an inverse element. A trans-
</p>
<p>formation followed by its inverse transformation is, by definition
</p>
<p>of the inverse transformation, the same as the identity transforma-
</p>
<p>tion. In the above examples this means that the inverse transfor-
</p>
<p>mation of a rotation by 90◦ is a rotation by -90◦. A rotation by 90◦
</p>
<p>followed by a rotation by -90◦ is the same as a rotation by 0◦.
</p>
<p>&bull; Performing a symmetry transformation followed by a second
</p>
<p>symmetry transformation is again a symmetry transformation. A
</p>
<p>rotation by 90◦ followed by a rotation by 180◦ is a rotation by 270◦,
which is a symmetry transformation, too. This property of the set
</p>
<p>of transformations is called closure.
</p>
<p>&bull; The combination of transformations must be associative3. A rota-3 But not commutative! For example
rotations around different axes do
not commute. This means in general:
Rx(θ)Rz(Φ) �= Rz(Φ)Rx(θ)
</p>
<p>tion by 90◦ followed by a rotation by 40◦, followed by a rotation
by 110◦ is the same as a rotation by 130◦ followed by a rotation by
110◦, which is the same as a rotation by 90◦ followed by a rotation
by 150◦. In a symbolic form:
</p>
<p>R(110◦)R(40◦)R(90◦) = R(110◦)
(
</p>
<p>R(40◦)R(90◦)
)
= R(110◦)R(130◦)
</p>
<p>(3.1)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>R(110◦)R(40◦)R(90◦) =
(
</p>
<p>R(110◦)R(40◦)
)
</p>
<p>R(90◦) = R(150◦)R(90◦)
(3.2)
</p>
<p>This property is called associativity.
</p>
<p>&bull; To be able to talk about the things above, one needs a rule, to be
</p>
<p>precise: a binary operation, for the combination of group ele-
</p>
<p>ments. In the above examples, the standard approach would be
</p>
<p>to use rotation matrices4 and the rule for combining the group4 If you want to know more about the
derivation of rotation matrices have a
look at Appendix A.2.
</p>
<p>elements (the corresponding rotation matrices) would be ordi-
</p>
<p>nary matrix multiplication. Nevertheless, there are often different
</p>
<p>ways to describe the same thing5 and group theory enables us to5 For example, rotations in the plane
can be described alternatively by
multiplication with unit complex
numbers. The rule for combining group
elements is then complex number
multiplication. This will be discussed
later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>study this systematically. The branch of group theory that deals
</p>
<p>with different descriptions of the same transformations is called
</p>
<p>representation theory6.
</p>
<p>6 Representation theory is the topic of
Section 3.5.
</p>
<p>To work with ideas like these in a rigorous, mathematical way, one
</p>
<p>distils the defining features of such transformations and promotes
</p>
<p>them to axioms. All structures satisfying these axioms are then called
</p>
<p>groups. This paves the way for a whole new branch of mathematics,
</p>
<p>called group theory. It is possible to find very abstract structures</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lie group theory 29
</p>
<p>satisfying the group axioms, but we will stick with groups that are
</p>
<p>very similar to the rotations we explored above.
</p>
<p>After the discussion above, we can see that the abstract definition
</p>
<p>of a group simply states (obvious) properties of symmetry transfor-
</p>
<p>mations:
</p>
<p>A group (G, ◦) is a set G, together with a binary operation ◦ defined
on G, that satisfies the following axioms7 7 Do not worry too much about this.
</p>
<p>In practice one checks for some kind
of transformation if they obey these
axioms. If they do, the transformations
form a group and one can use the
results of group theory to learn more
about the transformations in question.
</p>
<p>&bull; Closure: For all g1, g2 &isin; G, g1 ◦ g2 &isin; G
</p>
<p>&bull; Identity element: There exists an identity element e &isin; G such that
for all g &isin; G, g ◦ e = g = e ◦ g
</p>
<p>&bull; Inverse element: For each g &isin; G, there exists an inverse element
g&minus;1 &isin; G such that g ◦ g&minus;1 = e = g&minus;1 ◦ g.
</p>
<p>&bull; Associativity: For all g1, g2, g3 &isin; G, g1 ◦ (g2 ◦ g3) = (g1 ◦ g2) ◦ g3.
</p>
<p>To summarize: The set of all transformations that leave a given
</p>
<p>object invariant is called a symmetry group. For Minkowski space-
</p>
<p>time, the object that is left invariant is the Minkowski metric8 and the 8 Recall, this is the tool which we use
to compute distances and lengths in
Minkowski space.
</p>
<p>corresponding symmetry group is called the Poincar&eacute; group.
</p>
<p>Take note that the characteristic properties of a group are defined
</p>
<p>completely independent of the object the transformations act on. We
</p>
<p>can therefore study such symmetry transformations without making
</p>
<p>references to any object we extracted them from. This is very useful,
</p>
<p>because there can be many objects with the same symmetry or at
</p>
<p>least the same kind of symmetry. Using group theory we no longer
</p>
<p>have to inspect each object on its own, but are now able to study
</p>
<p>general properties of symmetry transformations.
</p>
<p>3.2 Rotations in two Dimensions
</p>
<p>As a first step, we start with an easy, but important, example. What
</p>
<p>transformations in two dimensions leave the length of any vector
</p>
<p>unchanged? After thinking about it for a while, we come up with9 9 Another kind of transformation that
leaves the length of a vector unchanged
are translations, which means we move
every point a constant distance in a
specified direction. These are described
mathematically a bit different and we
are going to talk about them later.
</p>
<p>rotations and reflections. These transformations are of course the
</p>
<p>same ones that map the unit circle into the unit circle. This is an ex-
</p>
<p>ample of how one group may act on different kinds of objects: On the
</p>
<p>circle, which is a geometric shape, and on a vector. Considering vec-
</p>
<p>tors, one can represent these transformations by rotation matrices10,
10 For an explicit derivation of these
matrices have a look a look at Ap-
pendix A.2.</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>and describe two-dimensional rotations about the origin by angle θ.
</p>
<p>Reflections at the axes can be performed using the matrices:

</p>
<p>)
Py =
</p>
<p>(
1 0
</p>
<p>0 &minus;1
</p>
<p>)
. (3.4)
</p>
<p>You can check that these matrices, together with the ordinary
</p>
<p>matrix multiplication as binary operation ◦, satisfy the group axioms
and therefore these transformations form a group.
</p>
<p>We can formulate the task of finding "all transformations in two
</p>
<p>dimensions that leave the length of any vector unchanged" in a more
</p>
<p>abstract way. The length of a vector is given by the scalar product of
</p>
<p>the vector with itself. If the length of the vector is the same after the
</p>
<p>transformation a &rarr; a&prime;, the equation
</p>
<p>a&prime; &middot; a&prime; != a &middot; a (3.5)
</p>
<p>must hold. We denote the transformation with O and write the trans-
</p>
<p>formed vector as a &rarr; a&prime; = Oa. Thus
</p>
<p>a &middot; a = aTa &rarr; a&prime;Ta&prime; = (Oa)TOa = aTOTOa != aTa = a &middot; a, (3.6)
</p>
<p>where we can see the condition a transformation must fulfil to leave
</p>
<p>the length of a vector unchanged is
</p>
<p>OTO = I, (3.7)
</p>
<p>where I denotes the unit matrix11. You can check that the well-11 I =

</p>
<p>known rotation and reflection matrices we cited above fulfil exactly
</p>
<p>this condition12. This condition for two dimensional matrices defines12 With the matrix from

<p>the group O(2), which is the group of all13 orthogonal 2&times; 2 matrices.
</p>
<p>13 Every orthogonal 2&times; 2 matrix can
be written either in the form of Eq. 3.3,
as in Eq. 3.4, or as a product of these
matrices.
</p>
<p>We can find a subgroup of this group that includes only rotations, by
</p>
<p>observing that it follows from the condition in Eq. 3.7 that

</p>
<p>The transformations of the group with det(O) = 1 are rotations14 and

the matrices in Eq. 3.3 and Eq. 3.4.

</p>
<p>3.2.1 Rotations with Unit Complex Numbers
</p>
<p>There is a different way to describe rotations in two dimensions that
</p>
<p>makes use of complex numbers: rotations about the origin by angle
</p>
<p>θ can be described by multiplication with a unit complex number (
</p>
<p>z = a + ib which fulfils the condition16 |z|2 = z⋆z = 1). 16 The ⋆ symbol denotes complex
conjugation: z = a + ib &rarr; z⋆ = a &minus; ib
</p>
<p>The unit complex numbers together with ordinary complex num-
</p>
<p>ber multiplication are a group, called17 U(1), as you can check by 17 The U stands for unitary, which
means the condition U&dagger;U = 1, where
the symbol "&dagger;", called "dagger", denotes
transposition plus complex conjugation:
U&dagger; = UT⋆. For numbers, the dagger
operation &dagger; is the same as taking only
the complex conjugate, because every
number satisfies trivially zT = z. Hence
the condition reduces here simply to
U⋆ = U.
</p>
<p>looking at the group axioms. To establish the connection with the
</p>
<p>group definitions for O(2) and SO(2) introduced above, we write the
</p>
<p>defining condition for unit numbers as18
</p>
<p>18 For more general information about
the definition of groups involving a
complex product, have a look at the
appendix in Section 3.10.
</p>
<p>U⋆U = 1 . (3.11)
</p>
<p>Another way to write a unit complex number is19
</p>
<p>19 This is known as Euler&rsquo;s formula,
which is derived in Appendix B.4.2.
For a complex number z = a + ib, a is
called the real part of z: Re(z) = a and
b the imaginary part: Im(z) = b. In
Euler&rsquo;s formula cos(θ) is the real part,
and sin(θ) the imaginary part of Rθ .
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.5: The unit complex numbers lie
on the unit circle in the complex plane.
</p>
<p>Rθ = e
iθ = cos(θ) + i sin(θ), (3.12)
</p>
<p>because then
</p>
<p>R⋆θRθ = e
&minus;iθeiθ =
</p>
<p>(
cos(θ)&minus; i sin(θ)
</p>
<p>)(
cos(θ) + i sin(θ)
</p>
<p>)
= 1 (3.13)
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at an example: we rotate the complex number
</p>
<p>z = 3+ 5i, by 90◦:
</p>
<p>z &rarr; z&prime; = ei90◦z = (cos(90◦)︸ ︷︷ ︸
=0
</p>
<p>+i sin(90◦)︸ ︷︷ ︸
=1
</p>
<p>)(3+ 5i) = i(3+ 5i) = 3i &minus; 5 .
</p>
<p>(3.14)
</p>
<p>The two complex numbers are plotted in Fig. 3.6 and we see the
</p>
<p>multiplication with ei90
◦
does indeed rotate the complex number by
</p>
<p>90◦. In this description, the rotation operator ei90
◦
acts on complex
</p>
<p>numbers instead of on vectors. To describe a rotation in two dimen-
</p>
<p>sions, one parameter is necessary: the angle of rotation θ. A complex
</p>
<p>number has two degrees of freedom and with the constraint to unit
</p>
<p>complex numbers |z| = 1, one degree of freedom is left as needed.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>32 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>We can connect this description to the previous one, where we
</p>
<p>used rotation matrices, by representing complex numbers by real
</p>
<p>2&times; 2 matrices. We define
</p>
<p>1 =
</p>
<p>(
1 0
</p>
<p>0 1
</p>
<p>)
, i =
</p>
<p>(
0 &minus;1
1 0
</p>
<p>)
. (3.15)
</p>
<p>You can check that these matrices fulfil
</p>
<p>12 = 1, i2 = &minus;1, 1i = i1 = i. (3.16)
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.6: Rotation of a complex number,
by multiplication with a unit complex
number
</p>
<p>So now, the complex representation of rotations of the plane reads
</p>
<p>Rθ = cos(θ) + i sin(θ) = cos(θ)
</p>
<p>(
1 0
</p>
<p>0 1

</p>
<p>(

<p>)
. (3.17)
</p>
<p>By making the map
</p>
<p>i &rarr; real matrix,
</p>
<p>we go back to the familiar representation of rotations of the plane.
</p>
<p>Maybe you have noticed a subtle point: The familiar rotation matrix
</p>
<p>in 2-dimensions acts on vectors, but here we identified the complex
</p>
<p>unit i with a real matrix (Eq. 3.15). Therefore, the rotation matrix
</p>
<p>will act on a 2 &times; 2 matrix, because the complex number we act on
becomes a matrix, too.
</p>
<p>A generic complex number in this description reads
</p>
<p>z = a + ib = a
</p>
<p>(
1 0
</p>
<p>0 1
</p>
<p>)
+ b
</p>
<p>(
0 &minus;1
1 0
</p>
<p>)
=
</p>
<p>(
a &minus;b
b a
</p>
<p>)
. (3.18)
</p>
<p>Let us take a look at how rotations act on such a matrix that repre-
</p>
<p>sents a complex number:
</p>
<p>z&prime; =
</p>
<p>(
a&prime; &minus;b&prime;
b&prime; a&prime;
</p>
<p>)
= Rθz =

sin(θ)a + cos(θ)b &minus; sin(θ)b + cos(θ)a
</p>
<p>)
. (3.19)
</p>
<p>By comparing the left-hand side with the right-hand side, we get
</p>
<p>&rarr; a&prime; = cos(θ)a &minus; sin(θ)b
&rarr; b&prime; = sin(θ)a + cos(θ)b , (3.20)</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>which is the same result that we get when we act with Rθ on a col-

. (3.21)

<p>We see that both representations do exactly the same thing and math-

<p>ematically speaking we have an isomorphism20 between SO(2) and 20 An isomorphism is a one-to-one map

U(1). This is a very important discovery and we will elaborate on
</p>
<p>such lines of thought in the following chapters.
</p>
<p>Next we want to describe rotations in three dimensions and find
</p>
<p>similarly two descriptions for rotations in three dimensions21. 21 Things are about to get really interest-
ing! Analogous to the two-dimensional
case we discussed in the preceding sec-
tion, we will find a second description
of rotations in three dimensions and
this alternative description will reveal
something fundamental about nature.
</p>
<p>3.3 Rotations in three Dimensions
</p>
<p>The standard method to rotate vectors in three dimensions is to use
</p>
<p>3&times; 3 rotation matrices. The "basis rotations" around the three axes
can be described by the following matrices:
</p>
<p>Rx =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
1 0 0
</p>
<p>0 cos(θ) &minus; sin(θ)
0 sin(θ) cos(θ)
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ Ry =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>cos(θ) 0 sin(θ)
</p>
<p>0 1 0
</p>
<p>&minus; sin(θ) 0 cos(θ)
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠
</p>
<p>Rz =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
cos(θ) &minus; sin(θ) 0
sin(θ) cos(θ) 0
</p>
<p>0 0 1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ . (3.22)
</p>
<p>If we want to rotate the vector
</p>
<p>�v =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠
</p>
<p>around the z-axis22, we multiply it with the corresponding rotation 22 A general, rotated vector is derived
explicitly in Appendix A.2.matrix
</p>
<p>Rz(θ)�v =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
cos(θ) &minus; sin(θ) 0
sin(θ) cos(θ) 0
</p>
<p>0 0 1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝

</p>
<p>0
</p>

</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
cos(θ)
</p>
<p>sin(θ)
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ . (3.23)
</p>
<p>To get a second description for rotations in three dimensions, the
</p>
<p>first thing we have to do is find a generalisation of complex numbers
</p>
<p>in higher dimensions. A first guess may be to go from 2-dimensional
</p>
<p>complex numbers to 3-dimensional complex numbers, but it turns
</p>
<p>out that there are no 3-dimensional complex numbers. Instead, we
</p>
<p>can find 4-dimensional complex numbers, called quaternions. The</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>34 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>quaternions will prove to be the correct second tool to describe rota-
</p>
<p>tions in 3-dimensions and the fact that this tool is 4-dimensional re-
</p>

</p>
<p>this result, because to describe an arbitrary rotation in 3-dimensions,
</p>
<p>3 parameters are needed. Four dimensional complex numbers, with

<p>the constraint to unit quaternions23, have exactly 3 degrees of free-23 Remember that we used the con-

</p>
<p>dom.
</p>
<p>3.3.1 Quaternions
</p>
<p>The 4-dimensional complex numbers can be constructed analogous
</p>
<p>to the 2-dimensional complex numbers. Instead of just one complex
</p>
<p>"unit" we introduce three, named i, j,k. These fulfil
</p>
<p>i2 = j2 = k2 = &minus;1. (3.24)
</p>
<p>Then a 4-dimensional complex number, called a quaternion, can be
</p>
<p>written as
</p>
<p>q = a1 + bi + cj + dk. (3.25)
</p>
<p>We now need multiplication rules for ij =? etc., because products
</p>
<p>like this will occur when one multiplies two quaternions. The extra
</p>
<p>condition
</p>
<p>ijk = &minus;1 (3.26)
</p>
<p>suffices to compute all needed relations, for example ij=k follows
</p>
<p>from multiplying Eq. 3.26 with k:
</p>
<p>ij kk︸︷︷︸
=&minus;1
</p>
<p>= &minus;k &rarr; ij=k. (3.27)
</p>
<p>The set of unit quaternions q = a1 + bi + cj + dk satisfy the
</p>
<p>condition2424 The symbol &dagger;, here is called "dagger"
and denotes transposition plus complex
conjugation: a&dagger; = (a⋆)T . The ordinary
scalar product always includes a trans-
position a &middot; b = aTb, because matrix
multiplication requires that we multiply
a row with a column. In addition, for
complex entities we include complex
conjugation that makes sure we get
something real, which is important if
we want to interpret things in terms of
length.
</p>
<p>q&dagger;q

</p>
<p>&rarr; (a1 &minus; bi &minus; cj &minus; dk)(a1 + bi + cj + dk) = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 != 1.
(3.28)
</p>
<p>Exactly as the unit complex numbers formed a group under complex
</p>
<p>number multiplication, the unit quaternions form a group under
</p>
<p>quaternion multiplication.
</p>
<p>Analogous to what we did for two-dimensional complex numbers,
</p>
<p>we now represent each of the three complex units with a matrix.
</p>
<p>There are different ways of doing this, but one choice that does the
</p>
<p>job is as complex 2&times; 2 matrices:</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>)
. (3.29)
</p>
<p>You can check that these matrices fulfil the defining conditions in
</p>
<p>Eq. 3.24 and Eq. 3.26. Using these matrices a generic quaternion can
</p>
<p>then be written
</p>
<p>q = a1 + bi + cj + dk =
</p>
<p>(
a + di b + ci
</p>
<p>&minus;b + ci a &minus; di
</p>
<p>)
. (3.30)
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have
</p>
<p>det(q) = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2. (3.31)
</p>
<p>Comparing this with Eq. 3.28 tells us that the set of unit quaternions
</p>
<p>is given by matrices of the above form with unit determinant. The
</p>
<p>unit quaternions, written as complex 2&times; 2 matrices therefore fulfil
the conditions
</p>
<p>U&dagger;U = 1 and det(U) = 1. (3.32)
</p>
<p>Take note that the way we define SU(2) here, is analogously to how
</p>
<p>we defined SO(2). The S denotes special, which means det(U) = 1
</p>
<p>and U stands for unitary, which means the property25 U&dagger;U = 1. 25 For some more information about
this, have a look at the Appendix 3.10 at
the end of this chapter.
</p>
<p>Through the map in Eq. 3.29, every unit quaternion can be identified
</p>
<p>with an element of SU(2).
</p>
<p>Now, how is SU(2) and with it the unit quaternions related to
</p>
<p>rotations? Unfortunately, the map between SU(2) and26 SO(3) is not 26 Recall that SO(3) is the set of the
usual rotation matrices acting on 3
dimensional vectors.
</p>
<p>as simple as the one between U(1) and SO(2).
</p>
<p>In 2-dimensions the 2 parameters of a complex number z = a + ib
</p>
<p>could be easily identified with the two spatial axes, i.e. v = x + iy.
</p>
<p>The restriction to unit complex numbers automatically makes sure
</p>
<p>that the resulting matrix preserves the length of any vector27 27 Recall that here R is a unit complex
number, because complex numbers
can be rotated by multiplication with
unit complex numbers. Therefore we
have U⋆U = 1, which is the defining
condition for unit complex numbers.
</p>
<p>(Uz)⋆Uz = z⋆U⋆Uz = z⋆z.
</p>
<p>The quaternions have 4 parameters, so the identification with the 3
</p>
<p>coordinates of a three-dimensional vector is not obvious. When we
</p>
<p>define
</p>
<p>v &equiv; xi + yj + zk (3.33)
</p>
<p>and use the matrix representation of the quaternions (Eq. 3.29), we
</p>
<p>can compute
</p>
<p>det(v) = x2 + y2 + z2. (3.34)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to consider transformations that preserve the
</p>
<p>length of the vector (x, y, z), we must use matrix transformations that
</p>
<p>preserve determinants. Therefore the restriction to unit quaternions
</p>
<p>means that we must restrict to matrices with unit determinant28.28 This follows from the general rule
det(BA) = det(B)det(A). Therefore, if
B has determinant 1, the product matrix
BA has the same determinant as A.
</p>
<p>Everything may now seem straight forward, but there is a subtle
</p>
<p>point. A first guess would be that a unit quaternion u induces a
</p>
<p>rotation on v simply by multiplication. This is not the case, because
</p>
<p>the product of u and v may not belong to Ri +Rj +Rk. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the transformed vector can have a component we are not able to
</p>
<p>interpret29. Instead the transformation that does the job is given by29 We identify our spatial components
x, y, z as components in the subspace
Ri + Rj + Rk. If, as a result of a
transformation, we end up with a
coefficient that does not belong to this
subspace, i.e. does not appear together
with i, j or k, we can&rsquo;t interpret it.
</p>
<p>v&prime; = qvq&minus;1. (3.35)
</p>
<p>It turns out that by making this identification unit quaternions can
</p>
<p>describe rotations in 3-dimensions.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at an explicit example: To make the connection
</p>
<p>to our example in two dimensions, we define u as a unit quaternion
</p>
<p>that only takes values in Ri + Rj + Rk and denote a general unit
</p>
<p>quaternion with
</p>
<p>t = cos(θ) + sin(θ)u. (3.36)
</p>
<p>Using Eq. 3.33 a generic vector can be written
</p>
<p>�v = (vx, vy, vz)
T = vxi + vyj + vzk =︸︷︷︸
</p>
<p>Eq. 3.30
</p>
<p>(
ivz vx + ivy
</p>
<p>&minus;vx + ivy &minus;ivz
</p>
<p>)
.
</p>
<p>(3.37)
</p>
<p>With the identifications made above, we want to rotate, as an ex-
</p>
<p>ample, a vector �v = (1, 0, 0)T around the z-axis. We will make a
</p>
<p>particular choice for the vector and for the quaternion representing
</p>
<p>the rotation and show that it works. We write, using quaternions in
</p>
<p>their matrix representation (Eq. 3.29)
</p>
<p>�v = (1, 0, 0)T &rarr; v = 1i + 0j + 0k =
(
</p>
<p>0 1
</p>
<p>&minus;1 0
</p>
<p>)
. (3.38)
</p>
<p>In addition, we use the following quaternion
</p>
<p>Rz(θ) = cos(θ)1 + sin(θ)k =
</p>
<p>(
cos(θ) + i sin(θ) 0
</p>
<p>0 cos(θ)&minus; i sin(θ)
</p>
<p>)
,
</p>
<p>(3.39)
</p>
<p>and then calculate that it is the correct quaternion that describes a
</p>
<p>rotation around the z-axis. We can rewrite Rz using Euler&rsquo;s formula
3030 For a derivation have a look at Ap-

<p>&minus; cos(2θ) + i sin(2θ) 0
</p>
<p>)
.
</p>
<p>(3.42)
</p>
<p>On the other hand, an arbitrary vector can be written in our
</p>
<p>quaternion notation (Eq. 3.37)
</p>
<p>v&prime; =
</p>
<p>(
iv&prime;z v&prime;x + iv&prime;y
</p>
<p>&minus;v&prime;x + iv&prime;y &minus;iv&prime;z
</p>
<p>)
, (3.43)
</p>
<p>which we now compare with Eq. 3.42. This yields
</p>
<p>v&prime;x = cos(2θ) , v
&prime;
y = sin(2θ) , v
</p>
<p>&prime;
z = 0. (3.44)
</p>
<p>Therefore, written again in the conventional vector notation
</p>
<p>&rarr; �v&prime; = (cos(2θ), sin(2θ), 0)T . (3.45)
</p>
<p>Our identifications do indeed induce rotations31, but something 31 See the example in Eq. 3.23 where we
rotated the vector, using the conven-
tional rotation matrix
</p>
<p>needs our attention. We haven&rsquo;t rotated �v by θ, but by 2θ. Therefore,
</p>
<p>we define φ &equiv; 2θ, because then φ really represents the angle we
rotate. Using this definition we rewrite Eq. 3.36, which yields
</p>
<p>t = cos(
φ
</p>
<p>2
) + sin(
</p>
<p>φ
</p>
<p>2
)u . (3.46)
</p>
<p>We can now see that the identifications we made are not one-to-
</p>
<p>one, but rather we have two unit-quaternions describing the same
</p>
<p>rotation. For example32 32 A rotation by π is the same as a
rotation by 3π = 2π + π for ordinary
vectors, because 2π = 360◦ is a full
rotation. In other words: We can see
that two quaternions u and &minus;u can be
used to rotate a vector by π.
</p>
<p>tφ=π = u
</p>
<p>��
</p>
<p>tφ=3π = &minus;u

Vector Rotation by π
</p>
<p>This is the reason SU(2) is called the double-cover of SO(3). It is
</p>
<p>always possible to go unambiguously from SU(2) to SO(3) but not</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>38 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>vice versa. One may think this is just a mathematical side-note, but
</p>
<p>we will understand later that groups which cover other groups are
</p>
<p>indeed more fundamental33.33 To spoil the surprise: We will use
the double cover of the Lorentz group,
instead of the Lorentz group itself,
because otherwise we miss something
important: Spin. Spin is some kind
of internal momentum and one of the
most important particle labels. This is
discussed in detail in Section 4.5.4 and
Section 8.5.5.
</p>
<p>To be able to discover the group that covers a given group, we
</p>
<p>need to introduce the most important tool of Lie theory: Lie algebras.
</p>
<p>This is the topic of the next section.
</p>
<p>Take note that the fact we had one quaternion parameter too
</p>
<p>many, may be interpreted as a hint towards relativity. One may ar-
</p>
<p>gue that a more natural identification would have been, as in the
</p>
<p>two-dimensional case, v = t1 + xi + yj + zk. We see that pure math-
</p>
<p>ematics pushes us towards the idea of using a 4th component and
</p>
<p>what could it be, if not time? If we now want to describe rotations
</p>
<p>in 4-dimensions, because we know that the universe we live in is
</p>
<p>4-dimensional, we have two choices:
</p>
<p>&bull; We could search for even higher dimensional complex numbers or
</p>
<p>&bull; we could again try to work with quaternions.
</p>
<p>From the last paragraph it may seem that quaternions have some-
</p>
<p>thing to say about rotations in 4 dimensions, too. An arbitrary ro-
</p>
<p>tation in 4 dimensions is described by34 6 parameters. There is no34 Using ordinary matrices, we need
in four dimensions 4 &times; 4 matrices.
The two conditions OTO = 1 and
det(O) = 1 reduce the 16 components
of an arbitrary 4 &times; 4 matrix to six
independent components.
</p>
<p>7-dimensional generalisation of complex numbers, which together
</p>
<p>with the constraint to unit objects would have 6 free parameters.
</p>
<p>However, two unit quaternions have exactly 6 free parameters. There-
</p>
<p>fore, maybe it&rsquo;s possible to describe a rotation in 4-dimensions by two
</p>
<p>quaternions? We will learn later that there is indeed a close connec-
</p>
<p>tion between two copies of SU(2) and rotations in four dimensions.
</p>
<p>3.4 Lie Algebras
</p>
<p>Lie theory is all about continuous symmetries. An example is the
</p>
<p>continuous symmetry of the unit circle we discussed at the beginning
</p>
<p>of this chapter. Continuous here means that there are infinitely many
</p>
<p>symmetry transformations, that can be parametrized continuously
</p>
<p>by one or several parameters. For example, the rotation angle φ in
</p>
<p>the circle example can be any value: 0.1◦, 0.11◦, 0.11991◦, . . ... In
contrast, for discrete symmetries like a reflection symmetry there is
</p>
<p>no continuous transformation parameter.
</p>
<p>An important observation in Lie theory is that for continuous sym-
</p>
<p>metries there are elements of the group which are arbitrarily close to
</p>
<p>the identity transformation35. In contrast, for a discrete group there35 The identity transformation is the
transformation that changes nothing at
all. For example, a rotation by 0◦ is an
identity transformation.
</p>
<p>is no continuous transformation parameter and therefore no element
</p>
<p>arbitrarily close to the identity. Consider again the symmetries of a</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lie group theory 39
</p>
<p>square. A rotation by 0,000001◦, which is very close to the identity
transformation (= a rotation by 0◦), is not in the set of symmetry
transformations of the square. In contrast, a rotation by 0,000001◦ is a
symmetry of the circle. The symmetry group of a circle is continuous,
</p>
<p>because the rotation parameter (the rotation angle) can take on arbi-
</p>
<p>trary (continuous) values. Mathematically, with the identity denoted
</p>
<p>I, an element g close to the identity is denoted
</p>
<p>g(ǫ) = I + ǫX , (3.47)
</p>
<p>where ǫ is, as always in mathematics, a really, really small number
</p>
<p>and X is an object, called generator, we will talk about in a moment.
</p>
<p>Such small transformations, when acting on some object change
</p>
<p>barely anything. In the smallest possible case such transformations
</p>
<p>are called infinitesimal transformation. Nevertheless, repeating such
</p>
<p>an infinitesimal transformation often, results in a finite transforma-
</p>
<p>tion. Think about rotations: many small rotations in one direction are
</p>
<p>equivalent to one big rotation in the same direction. Mathematically,
</p>
<p>we can write the idea of repeating a small transformation many times
</p>
<p>h(θ) = (I + ǫX)(I + ǫX)(I + ǫX)... = (I + ǫX)k, (3.48)
</p>
<p>where k denotes how often we repeat the small transformation. If
</p>
<p>θ denotes some finite transformation parameter, e.g. 50◦ or so, and
N is some really big number which makes sure we are close to the
</p>
<p>identity, we can write the element close to the identity as
</p>
<p>g(θ) = I +
θ
</p>
<p>N
X. (3.49)
</p>
<p>The transformations we want to consider are the smallest possible,
</p>
<p>which means N must be the biggest possible number, i.e. N &rarr; &infin;. To
get a finite transformation from such a infinitesimal transformation,
</p>
<p>one has to repeat the infinitesimal transformation infinitely. Mathe-
</p>
<p>matically
</p>
<p>h(θ) = lim
N&rarr;&infin;
</p>
<p>(I +
θ
</p>
<p>N
X)N , (3.50)
</p>
<p>which is in the limit just the exponential function36 36 This is often used as a definition
of the exponential function. A proof,
showing the equivalence of this limit
and the exponential series we derive in
Appendix B.4.1, can be found in most
books about analysis.
</p>
<p>h(θ) = lim
N&rarr;&infin;
</p>
<p>(I +
θ
</p>
<p>N
X)N = eθX . (3.51)
</p>
<p>In some sense the object X generates the finite transformation h,
</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s called the generator.
</p>
<p>If we want to calculate the generator X of a given transformation,
</p>
<p>we can differentiate the above formula</p>
<p/>

<p>dθ
h(θ) =

<p>d
</p>
<p>dθ
eθX = XeθX . (3.52)
</p>
<p>Thus, if we evaluate this formula at θ = 0, we get
</p>
<p>X =
dh(θ)
</p>
<p>dθ
</p>
<p>∣∣∣
θ=0
</p>
<p>. (3.53)
</p>
<p>The idea behind such lines of thought is that one can learn a lot
</p>
<p>about a group by looking at the important part of the infinitesimal
</p>
<p>elements (denoted X above): the generators. This will be made more
</p>
<p>precise in a moment, but first let&rsquo;s look at this from another perspec-
</p>
<p>tive that makes it even clearer in what sense the generators generate
</p>
<p>a finite transformation:
</p>
<p>If we consider a continuous group of transformations that are
</p>
<p>given by matrices, we can make a Taylor expansion37 of an element37 If you&rsquo;ve never heard of the Taylor
expansion, or Taylor series before,
you are encouraged to have a look at
Appendix B.3.
</p>
<p>of the group about the identity. The Taylor series is given by
</p>
<p>h(θ) = I +
dh

<p>dθ

<p>n!
</p>
<p>dnh
</p>
<p>dθn
∣∣
θ=0
</p>
<p>θn. (3.54)
</p>
<p>This shows nicely how the generators generate transformations.
</p>
<p>For matrix Lie groups one defines the corresponding Lie algebra
</p>
<p>as the collection of objects that give an element of the group when
</p>
<p>exponentiated. This is an easy definition one can use when restrict-
</p>
<p>ing to matrix Lie groups. Later we will introduce a more general
</p>
<p>definition. In mathematical terms3838 The Lie algebra which belongs to a
group G is conventionally denoted by
the corresponding "Fraktur" letter g For a Lie Group G (given by n &times; n matrices), the Lie algebra g of
</p>
<p>G is given by those n &times; n matrices X such that etX &isin; G for t &isin; R,
together with an operation, called the Lie bracket [, ] that tells us how
</p>
<p>we can combine these matrices.
</p>
<p>The last part of this definition can be a bit confusing and thus we
</p>
<p>now spent some time discussing it.
</p>
<p>We know from the definition of a group, that a group is more
</p>
<p>than just a collection of transformations. The definition of a group
</p>
<p>includes a binary operation ◦ that tells us how to combine group
elements. For matrix Lie groups this is just ordinary matrix multi-
</p>
<p>plication. Naively one may think that the same combination rule ◦
is valid for elements of the Lie algebra, but this is not the case! The
</p>
<p>elements of the Lie algebra are given by matrices39, but the multipli-39 A famous theorem of Lie group
theory, called Ado&rsquo;s Theorem, states
that every Lie algebra is isomorphic to a
matrix Lie algebra.
</p>
<p>cation of two Lie algebra elements doesn&rsquo;t need to be an element of
</p>
<p>the Lie algebra. Instead there is another combination rule for the Lie</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lie group theory 41
</p>
<p>algebra, already mentioned in the definition above, that is directly
</p>
<p>connected to the combination rule of the corresponding Lie group.
</p>
<p>The connection between the combination rule of the Lie group
</p>
<p>and the combination rule of the Lie algebra is given by the famous
</p>
<p>Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula40 40 We will not talk about the proof of
this formula in this book. Proofs can be
found in most books about Lie theory,

</p>
<p>gle object of the group and the multiplication of the group elements
</p>
<p>have been translated to a sum of Lie algebra elements. The new sym-
</p>
<p>bol in this sum [ , ] is called Lie bracket and for matrix Lie groups
</p>
<p>it is given by [X,Y] = XY &minus; YX, which is called the commutator
of X and Y. The elements XY and YX need not to be part of the Lie
</p>
<p>algebra, but their difference always is42! 42 A very illuminating proof of this fact
can be found in John Stillwell. Naive Lie
Theory. Springer, 1st edition, August
2008. ISBN 978-0387782140
</p>
<p>We learn from the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff-Formula that the
</p>
<p>natural product of the Lie algebra is, not as one would naively think,
</p>
<p>ordinary matrix multiplication, but the Lie bracket [, ]. One says,
</p>
<p>the Lie algebra is closed under the Lie bracket, just as the group
</p>
<p>is closed under the corresponding composition rule ◦, e.g. matrix
multiplication. Closure means that the composition of two elements
</p>
<p>lies again in the same set43. 43 For group elements g, h &isin; G we have
g ◦ h &isin; G. For elements of the Lie
algebra X,Y &isin; g we have [X,Y] &isin; g and
in general X ◦ Y �&isin; g
</p>
<p>After looking at an example to illustrate these new notions, we
</p>
<p>will have a look at the modern definition of a Lie algebra. The main
</p>
<p>component of this definition is how the generators of a group behave
</p>
<p>when put into the Lie bracket. By using this general definition we
</p>
<p>will see that it is possible to say that different groups have the same
</p>
<p>Lie algebra. With the definition above saying something like this
</p>
<p>would make little sense. Nevertheless, this new way of thinking
</p>
<p>about Lie algebras will enable us to reveal the most fundamental
</p>
<p>description corresponding to a given transformation. This is possible
</p>
<p>because there is a theorem in Lie theory that tells us that there is
</p>
<p>exactly one distinguished Lie group for each Lie algebra. The Lie
</p>
<p>algebra however, according to the abstract definition, corresponds to
</p>
<p>many Lie groups. We will make this more concrete after introducing
</p>
<p>the modern definition of a Lie group.</p>

trix A, which means the sum of all
elements on the main diagonal. For

<p>We now have the generators of the group in explicit matrix form

product of the Lie algebra is the Lie
bracket. Here we compute how the
basis generators behave, when put into
the Lie bracket. All other generators can
be constructed by linear combination
of these basis generators. Therefore, if
we know the result of the Lie bracket
of the basis generators, we know
automatically the result for all other
generators. This behavior of the basis
generators in the Lie bracket, will
become incredibly important in the next
section. Everything that is important
about a Lie algebra, is encoded in
the Lie bracket relation of the basis
generators.

cause everything important is encoded

</p>
<p>We introduce the additional "i" in physics to get Hermitian gen-
</p>
<p>erators, which means generators that satisfy52 J&dagger; = (J⋆)T = J. This

<p>52 For example now we have J⋆1 =⎛

<p>⎛

</p>
<p>⎞
⎠ = J1
</p>
<p>is a nice property, because Hermitian matrices have real eigenval-
</p>
<p>ues and this becomes important in quantum mechanics where the
</p>
<p>eigenvalues of the generators are the values we expect to measure
</p>
<p>in experiments53. Without the "i", the generators are anti-Hermitian
</p>
<p>53 This will be discussed in Section 8.3.
</p>
<p>J&dagger; = (J⋆)T = &minus;J and the corresponding eigenvalues are imagi-
nary. This would make it less intuitive to interpret the eigenvalues as
</p>
<p>something that we can observe in experiments.
</p>
<p>We can derive the basis generators in another way, by starting with
</p>
<p>the well known rotation matrices and use Eq. 3.53: X = dhdθ |θ=0. For

<p>which is exactly the first generator in Eq. 3.61. Nevertheless, the

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lie group theory 45
</p>
<p>given finite transformation matrices. For the Lorentz group we will
</p>
<p>start with the definition of the group, derive the basis generators
</p>
<p>and only afterwards compute an explicit matrix form of the Lorentz
</p>
<p>transformations. If you already have explicit transformation matrices,
</p>
<p>you can always use Eq. 3.53 to derive the corresponding generators.
</p>
<p>Before we discuss the Lorentz group in more detail, we take a
</p>
<p>small detour and have a look at the modern definition of a Lie alge-
</p>
<p>bra. This modern definition is essential to get a deep understanding
</p>
<p>of the symmetries of nature.
</p>
<p>3.4.2 The Abstract Definition of a Lie Algebra
</p>
<p>Up to this point we used a simplified definition: The Lie algebra con-
</p>
<p>sists of all elements X that result in an element of the corresponding
</p>
<p>group G, when put into the exponential function eX &isin; G, and an op-
eration, called Lie bracket [, ], that we use to combine the Lie algebra
</p>
<p>elements.
</p>
<p>We already discussed that the last part of this definition is cru-
</p>
<p>cial. As for the group, we also need a rule to combine Lie algebra
</p>
<p>elements. By looking at the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff-Formula,
</p>
<p>we learned how the rule for the combination of group elements, is
</p>
<p>connected to the rule for the combination of Lie algebra elements.
</p>
<p>An important observation was that the rule for the combination of
</p>
<p>Lie algebra elements is not simply matrix multiplication, but a more
</p>
<p>complicated rule called Lie bracket.
</p>
<p>While this operation already appears in our simplified definition,
</p>
<p>we now introduce a more abstract definition where the Lie bracket is
</p>
<p>even more central54 54 This definition will prove to be
invaluable for the following sections
and it will become clear in a moment
in what sense the Lie bracket is "more
central".
</p>
<p>A Lie algebra is a vector space g equipped with a binary operation
</p>
<p>[, ]: g&times; g &rarr; g. The binary operation satisfies the following axioms:
</p>
<p>&bull; Bilinearity: [aX + bY, Z] = a[X, Z] + b[Y, Z] and [Z, aX + bY] =
</p>
<p>a[Z, X] + b[Z,Y] , for arbitrary number a, b and &forall;X,Y, Z &isin; g
</p>
<p>&bull; Anticommutativity: [X,Y] = &minus;[Y, X] &forall; X,Y &isin; g
</p>
<p>&bull; The Jacobi Identity: [X, [Y, Z]] + [Z, [X,Y]] + [Y, [Z, X]] = 0
</p>
<p>&forall;X,Y, Z &isin; g
</p>
<p>You can check that the commutator of two matrices fulfills all
</p>
<p>these conditions and of course this standard commutator was used to
</p>
<p>motivate these axioms. Nevertheless, there are quite different binary
</p>
<p>operations that fulfill these axioms, for example, the famous Poisson
</p>
<p>bracket of classical mechanics.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>46 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>The important point is that this definition makes no reference to
</p>
<p>any Lie group. The definition of a Lie algebra stands on its own and
</p>
<p>we will see that this makes a lot of sense. In the next section we will
</p>
<p>have a look at the generators of SU(2) and find that the basis gener-
</p>
<p>ators, which is the set of generators we can use to construct all other
</p>
<p>generators by linear combinations, fulfill the same Lie bracket rela-
</p>
<p>tion as the basis generators of SO(3) (Eq. 3.72). This is interpreted as
</p>
<p>SU(2) and SO(3) having the same Lie algebra. This is an incredibly
</p>
<p>important result and it will tell us a lot about SU(2) and SO(3).
</p>
<p>3.4.3 The Generators and Lie Algebra of SU(2)
</p>
<p>We stumbled upon SU(2) while trying to describe rotations in
</p>
<p>three dimensions and discovered that SU(2) is the double cover5555 Recall that this means that the map
from SU(2) to SO(3) identifies two
elements of SU(2) with the same
element of SO(3).
</p>
<p>of SO(3).
</p>
<p>Remember that SU(2) is the group of unitary 2&times; 2 matrices with
unit determinant56 :56 This is what the "S" stands for:
</p>
<p>Special = unit determinant.
</p>
<p>U&dagger;U = UU&dagger; = 1 (3.74)
</p>
<p>det(U) = 1 . (3.75)
</p>
<p>The first thing we now want to take a look at is the Lie algebra of
</p>
<p>this group. Writing the defining conditions of the group in terms of
</p>
<p>the generators J1, J2, . . . yields
5757 As discussed above, we now work
</p>
<p>with an extra "i" in the exponent, in
order to get Hermitian matrices, which
guarantees that we get real numbers as
predictions for experiments in quantum
mechanics.
</p>
<p>U&dagger;U = (ei Ji )&dagger;ei Ji
!
= 1 (3.76)
</p>
<p>det(U) = det(ei Ji )
!
= 1 (3.77)
</p>
<p>The first condition tells us, using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff
</p>
<p>theorem (Eq. 3.55) and [Ji, Ji] = 0
</p>
<p>(ei Ji )&dagger;ei Ji = e&minus;i J

</p>
<p>&rarr;︸︷︷︸
e0=1
</p>
<p>J&dagger;i
!
= Ji. (3.78)
</p>
<p>A matrix fulfilling the condition J&dagger;i = Ji is called Hermitian and we
</p>
<p>therefore learn here that the generators of SU(2) must be Hermitian.
</p>
<p>Using the identity det(eA) = etr(A), we see that the second condition
</p>
<p>yields

. (3.80)
</p>
<p>This means every Hermitian traceless 2&times; 2 matrix can be written as a
linear combination of these matrices that are called Pauli matrices.
</p>
<p>We can put these explicit matrices for the basis generators into the
</p>
<p>Lie bracket and this yields
</p>
<p>[σi, σj] = 2iǫijkσk, (3.81)
</p>
<p>where ǫijk is again the Levi-Civita symbol. To get rid of the nasty 2 it
</p>
<p>is conventional to define the generators of SU(2) as Ji &equiv; 12σi. The Lie
algebra then reads
</p>
<p>[Ji, Jj] = iǫijk Jk . (3.82)
</p>
<p>Take note that this is exactly the same Lie bracket relation we de-
</p>
<p>rived for SO(3) (Eq. 3.72)! Therefore one says that SU(2) and SO(3)
</p>
<p>have the same Lie algebra, because we define Lie algebras by their
</p>
<p>Lie bracket. We will use the abstract definition of this Lie algebra,
</p>
<p>to get different descriptions for the transformations described by
</p>
<p>SU(2). We will learn that an SU(2) transformation doesn&rsquo;t need to
</p>
<p>be described by 2&times; 2 matrices. To make sense of things like this, we
need a more abstract definition of a Lie group. At this point SU(2) is
</p>
<p>defined as a set of 2&times; 2 matrices, and a description of SU(2) by, for
example, 3&times; 3 matrices, makes little sense. The abstract definition of
a Lie group will enable us to see the connection between different de-
</p>
<p>scriptions of the same transformation. We will identify with each Lie
</p>
<p>group a geometrical object (a manifold) and use this abstract object to
</p>
<p>define a group. This may seem like a strange thought, but will make
</p>
<p>a lot of sense after taking a second look at two examples we already
</p>
<p>encountered in earlier sections.
</p>
<p>3.4.4 The Abstract Definition of a Lie Group
</p>
<p>One of the first Lie groups we discussed was U(1), the unit complex
</p>
<p>numbers. These are defined as complex numbers that satisfy z⋆z = 1.
</p>
<p>If we write z = a + ib this condition reads
</p>
<p>z⋆z = (a + ib)⋆(a + ib) = (a &minus; ib)(a + ib) = a2 + b2 = 1. (3.83)
</p>
<p>This is exactly the defining condition of the unit circle59. The set 59 The unit circle S1 is the set of all
points in two dimensions with distance
1 from the origin. In mathematical
terms this means all points (x1, x2)
fulfilling x21 + x

2 = 1.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>48 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>of unit-complex numbers is the unit circle in the complex plane.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we found that there is a one-to-one map60 between60 To be precise: an isomorphism. To
say two things are isomorphic is the
mathematical way of saying that they
are "the same thing". Two things are
called isomorphic if there exists an
isomorphism between them.
</p>
<p>elements of U(1) and SO(2). Therefore, for these groups it is easy
</p>
<p>to identify them with a geometric object: the unit circle. Instead of
</p>
<p>talking about different descriptions for SO(2) or U(1), which are
</p>
<p>defined by objects of given dimension, it can help to think about this
</p>
<p>group as the unit-circle. Rotations in two-dimensions are, as a Lie
</p>
<p>group, the unit-circle and we can represent these transformations
</p>
<p>by elements of SO(2), i.e. 2 &times; 2 matrices or elements of U(1), i.e.
unit-complex numbers.
</p>
<p>The next groups we discussed were SO(3) and SU(2). Remem-
</p>
<p>ber that we found a one-to-one map between SU(2) and the unit
</p>
<p>quaternions. The unit quaternions are defined as those quaternions
</p>
<p>q = a1 + bi + cj + dk that satisfy the condition (Eq. 3.28)
</p>
<p>a2 + b2 + c2 + d2
!
= 1, (3.84)
</p>
<p>which is the same condition that defines61 the three sphere S3! There-
</p>
<p>61 Recall that the unit circle S1 is defined
as the set of points that satisfy the
condition x21 + x
</p>
<p>2
2 = 1. Equally, the two-
</p>
<p>sphere S2 is defined by the condition
x21 + x

3 = 1 and analogously the

<p>The number that follows the S denotes
the dimension. In two dimensions,
with one condition we get a one-
dimensional object: S1. Equally we
get in four dimensions, with one

<p>dimensional object S3. S3 is the surface
of the four-dimensional ball.
</p>
<p>fore the quaternions provide us with a map between SU(2) and the
</p>
<p>three sphere S3. This map is an isomorphism (1-1 and onto) and
</p>
<p>therefore we can really think of SU(2) as the three sphere S3.
</p>
<p>These observations motivate the modern definition of a Lie group62:
</p>
<p>62 The technical details that follow aren&rsquo;t
important for what we want to do in
this book. Especially, don&rsquo;t worry if the
exact meaning of notions like "induces"
or "differentiable" is not clear. The
important message to take away is: Lie
group = manifold.
</p>
<p>A Lie group is a group, which is also a differentiable manifold63. Further-
</p>
<p>63 A manifold is a set of points, for ex-
ample a sphere that looks locally like
flat Euclidean space Rn. Another way of
thinking about a n-dimensional mani-
fold is that it&rsquo;s a set which can be given
n independent coordinates in some
neighborhood of any point. For some
more information about manifolds, see
the appendix in Section 3.11 at the end
of this chapter.
</p>
<p>more, the group operation ◦ must induce a differentiable map of the manifold
into itself. This is a compatibility requirement that ensures that the group
</p>
<p>property is compatible with the manifold property. Concretely this means
</p>
<p>that every group element, say A induces a map that takes any element of the
</p>
<p>group B to another element of the group C = AB and this map must be
</p>
<p>differentiable. Using coordinates this means that the coordinates of AB must
</p>
<p>be differentiable functions of the coordinates of B.
</p>
<p>We can now understand the remark at the end of Section 3.4:
</p>
<p>"... there is precisely one distinguished Lie group for each Lie alge-
</p>
<p>bra."
</p>
<p>a bit better64. From the geometric perspective, the distinguished
</p>
<p>64 Recall that we already discovered that
different groups can have the same Lie
algebra. For example, using the abstract
definition of a Lie algebra, we say that
SO(3) and SU(2) have the same Lie
algebra (Eq. 3.82).
</p>
<p>group has the property of being simply connected. This means that,
</p>
<p>if we use the modern definition of a Lie group as a manifold, any
</p>
<p>closed curve on this manifold can be shrunk smoothly to a point65.
65 We will not discuss this any further,
but you are encouraged to read about
it, for example in the books recom-
mended at the end of this chapter.
For the purpose of this book it suf-
fices to know that there is always one
distinguished group.
</p>
<p>To emphasize this important point:66

</p>
<p>There is precisely one simply-connected Lie group corresponding
</p>
<p>to each Lie algebra.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lie group theory 49
</p>
<p>This simply-connected group can be thought of as the "mother"
</p>
<p>of all those groups having the same Lie algebra, because there are
</p>
<p>maps to all other groups with the same Lie algebra from the simply
</p>
<p>connected group, but not vice versa. We could call it the mother
</p>
<p>group of this particular Lie algebra, but mathematicians tend to be
</p>
<p>less dramatic and call it the covering group. All other groups having
</p>
<p>the same Lie algebra are said to be covered by the simply connected
</p>
<p>one. We already stumbled upon an example of this: SU(2) is the
</p>
<p>double cover of SO(3). This means there is a two-to-one map from
</p>
<p>SU(2) to SO(3).
</p>
<p>Furthermore, SU(2) is the three sphere, which is a simply con-
</p>
<p>nected manifold. Therefore, we have already found the "most impor-
</p>
<p>tant" group belonging to the Lie algebra in Eq. 3.82. We can get all
</p>
<p>other groups belonging to this Lie algebra through maps from SU(2).
</p>
<p>We can now understand what manifold SO(3) is. The map from
</p>
<p>SU(2) to SO(3) identifies with two points of SU(2), one point of
</p>
<p>SO(3). Therefore, we can think of SO(3) as the top half67 of S3. 67 This picture is a bit oversimplified.
Strictly speaking SO(3) as a manifold is
still a sphere, but with antipodal points
identified.
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.7: Two-dimensional slice of
the three Sphere S3 (which is a three
dimensional surface and therefore not
drawable itself). We can see that the top
half of the sphere is SO(3), because to
get from SU(2) to SO(3) we identify
two points, for example, p and p + 2π,
with each other.
</p>
<p>We can see, from the point of view that Lie groups are manifolds
</p>
<p>that SU(2) is a more complete object than SO(3). SO(3) is just "part"
</p>
<p>of the complete object.
</p>
<p>In this book we take the view that to describe nature at the most
</p>
<p>fundamental level, we need to use the most fundamental groups.
</p>
<p>For rotations in three dimensions this group is SU(2) and not SO(3).
</p>
<p>We will discover something similar when considering the symmetry
</p>
<p>group of special relativity.
</p>
<p>We will see that Nature agrees with such lines of thought! To
</p>
<p>describe elementary particles one uses the representations of the
</p>
<p>covering group of the Poincar&eacute; group, instead of just the usual repre-
</p>
<p>sentation one uses to transform four-vectors. To describe nature at
</p>
<p>the most fundamental level, we must use the covering group, instead
</p>
<p>of any of the other groups that one can map to from the covering

<p>group.

<p>tions of the Lie algebra. We can then put the matrices representing
</p>
<p>the Lie algebra elements (the generators) into the exponential func-

<p>tion to get matrices representing group elements.
</p>
<p>Herein lies the strength of Lie theory. By using pure mathemat-

<p>mental group and therefore we will use it to describe nature70.
</p>
<p>70 In the following, we will use one
representation of the Poincar&eacute; group to
derive the corresponding Lie algebra.
Then we will use this Lie algebra to
derive the representations of the one
distinguished group that belongs to this
Lie algebra, which doubly covers the
Poincar&eacute; group.
</p>
<p>To summarize71
</p>
<p>71 Maybe you wonder why S2, the sur-
face of the sphere in three dimensions,
is missing. S2 is not a Lie group and
this is closely related to the fact that
there are no three-dimensional complex
numbers. Recall that we had to move
from two-dimensional complex num-
bers with just i to the four-dimensional
quaternions with i,j,k.

</p>
<p>Next, we will introduce another important branch of Lie theory,
</p>
<p>called representation theory. It is representation theory that enables
</p>
<p>us to derive from a given Lie group the tools that we need to describe
</p>
<p>nature at the most fundamental level.
</p>
<p>3.5 Representation Theory
</p>
<p>The important thing about group theory is that it is able to describe
</p>
<p>transformations without referring to any objects in the real world.
</p>
<p>For theoretical considerations it is often useful to regard any group
</p>
<p>as an abstract group. This means defining the group by its manifold
</p>
<p>structure and the group operation. For example SU(2) is the three
</p>
<p>sphere S3, the elements of the group are points of the manifold and
</p>
<p>the rule associating a product point ab with any two points b and a
</p>
<p>satisfies the usual group axioms. In physical applications one is more
</p>
<p>interested in what the group actually does, i.e. the group action.
</p>
<p>An important idea is that one group can act on many different
</p>
<p>kinds of objects72. This idea motivates the definition of a representa-72 This will make much more sense in a
moment. tion: A representation is a map73 between any group element g of a

<p>73 The mathematical term for a map
with these special properties is ho-
momorphism. The definition of an
isomorphism is then a homomorphism,
which is in addition one-to-one.
</p>
<p>group G and a linear transformation74 R(g) of some vector-space V
</p>
<p>74 In the context of this book this will
always mean that we map each group
element to a matrix. Each group ele-
ment is then given by a matrix that acts
by usual matrix multiplication on the
elements of some vector space.

generally if one accepts arbitrary (not
necessarily linear) transformations of
an arbitrary (not necessarily a vector)
space. Such a map is called a realiza-
tion. In physics one is concerned most
of the time with linear transformations
of objects living in some vector space
(for example Hilbert space in quantum
mechanics or Minkowski space for
special relativity), therefore the concept
of a representation is more relevant to
physics than the general concept called
realization.

</p>
<p>mation of a vector space. Although we define a representation as a
</p>
<p>map, most of the time we will call a set of matrices a representation.
</p>
<p>For example, the usual rotation matrices are a representation of the
</p>
<p>group SO(3) on the vector space76 R3. The rotation matrices are lin-
</p>
<p>76 R3 denotes three dimensional Eu-
clidean space, where elements are
ordinary 3 component vectors, as we
use them for example in Appendix A.1.
</p>
<p>ear transformations on R3. However, the important thing here is that
</p>
<p>we can examine the group action on other vector spaces, too!
</p>
<p>Using representation theory, we are able to investigate systemati-
</p>
<p>cally how a given group acts on very different vector spaces and that
</p>
<p>is where things start to get really interesting.
</p>
<p>One of the most important examples in physics is SU(2). For ex-
</p>
<p>ample, we can examine how SU(2) acts on the complex vector space
</p>
<p>of dimension one C1, which is especially easy, as we will see later. We
</p>
<p>can also investigate how SU(2) acts on C2. The objects living in C2
</p>
<p>are complex vectors of dimension two and therefore SU(2) acts on
</p>
<p>them as 2&times; 2 matrices. The matrices (=linear transformations) act-
ing on C2 are just the "usual" SU(2) matrices that we already know.
</p>
<p>In addition, we can examine how SU(2) acts on C3 or even higher
</p>
<p>dimensional vector spaces. There is a well defined framework for
</p>
<p>constructing such representations and as a result, SU(2) acts, for ex-
</p>
<p>ample, on complex vectors of dimension three as 3&times; 3 matrices. A
basis for the SU(2) generators when they act on C3 is given by77 77 We will learn later in this chapter how
</p>
<p>to derive these. At this point just take
notice that it is possible.

<p>As usual, we can compute matrices that represent elements of the

<p>One can go on and inspect how SU(2) acts on higher dimensional

the group was consequently called S3.

name makes it hard for beginners to
dive deeper into the subject using the
standard textbooks.

</p>
<p>U&dagger;U = 1 and det(U) = 1 (3.87)
</p>
<p>and now we write SU(2) transformations as 3&times; 3 matrices. Therefore</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>52 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>one must always keep in mind that we mean the abstract group, in-
</p>
<p>stead of the 2&times; 2 definition, when we talk about higher dimensional
representation of SU(2) or any other group.
</p>
<p>Typically a group is defined in the first place with the help of an
</p>
<p>explicit representation. For example, we began our discussion of
</p>
<p>SU(2) with explicit 2&times; 2 matrices. This approach enables us to study
the group properties concretely, as we did in the preceding sections.
</p>
<p>After this initial study it&rsquo;s often more helpful to regard the group
</p>
<p>as an abstract group79, because it&rsquo;s possible to find other, useful79 For SU(2) this means using S3.
</p>
<p>representations of the group.
</p>
<p>Before we move on to examples we need to define some abstract,
</p>
<p>but useful, notions. These notions will clarify the hierarchy of rep-
</p>
<p>resentations, because not every possible representation is equally
</p>
<p>fundamental.
</p>
<p>The first notion we want to talk about is called similarity trans-
</p>
<p>formation. Given a matrix R and an invertible80 matrix S then a80 A matrix S is called invertible, if
there exists a matrix T, such that
ST = TS = 1. The inverse matrix is
usually denoted S&minus;1.
</p>
<p>transformation of the form
</p>
<p>R &rarr; R&prime; = S&minus;1RS (3.88)
</p>
<p>is called a similarity transformation. The usefulness of this kind of
</p>
<p>transformation in this context lies in the fact that if we have a rep-
</p>
<p>resentation R(G) of a group G, then S&minus;1RS is also a representation.
This follows directly from the definition of a representation: Suppose
</p>
<p>we have two group elements g1, g2 and a map R: G &rArr; GL(V), i.e.
R(g1) and R(g2). This is a representation if
</p>
<p>R(g1)R(g2) = R(g1g2) (3.89)
</p>
<p>If we now look at the similarity transformation of the representa-
</p>
<p>tion
</p>
<p>S&minus;1R(g1) SS&minus;1︸ ︷︷ ︸
=1
</p>
<p>R(g2)S = S
&minus;1R(g1)R(g2)S = S&minus;1R(g1g2)S , (3.90)
</p>
<p>we see that this is a representation, too. Speaking colloquially, this
</p>
<p>means that if we have a representation, we can transform its elements
</p>
<p>wildly with literally any non-singular matrix S to get nicer matri-
</p>
<p>ces81.81 The freedom to perform similarity
transformations correspond to our
freedom to choose a basis for the vector
space our group acts on.
</p>
<p>The next notion we want to introduce is called invariant subspace.
</p>
<p>When we have a representation R of a group G on a vector space
</p>
<p>V, we call V&prime; &sube; V an invariant subspace if for82 v &isin; V&prime; we have82 Of course v &isin; V, too. The vector
space V &prime; must be part of the vector
space V, which is mathematically
denoted by V &prime; &sube; V. In other words this
means that every element of V&prime; is at the
same time an element of V.
</p>
<p>R(g)v &isin; V&prime; for all g &isin; G. This means, if we have a vector in the
subspace V&prime; and we act on it with arbitrary group elements, the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lie group theory 53
</p>
<p>transformed vector will always be again part of the subspace V&prime;. If
we find such an invariant subspace we can define a representation R&prime;
</p>
<p>of G on V&prime;, called a subrepresentation of R, by
</p>
<p>R&prime;(g)v = R(g)v (3.91)
</p>
<p>for all v &isin; V&prime;. Therefore, one is led to the thought that the represen-
tation R, we talked about in the first place, is not fundamental, but a
</p>
<p>composite of smaller building blocks, called subrepresentations.
</p>
<p>This leads us to the very important notion irreducible represen-
</p>
<p>tation. An irreducible representation is a representation of a group
</p>
<p>G on a vector space V that has no invariant subspaces besides the
</p>
<p>zero space {0} and V itself83. Such representations can be thought 83 The subspace consisting solely of the
identity element is always, trivially an
invariant subspace.
</p>
<p>of as truly fundamental, because they are not made up by smaller
</p>
<p>representations. The irreducible representations of a group are the
</p>
<p>building blocks from which we can build up all other representa-
</p>
<p>tions. There is another way to think about irreducible representation:
</p>
<p>An irreducible representation cannot be rewritten, using a similarity
</p>
<p>transformation, in block diagonal form84. In contrast, a reducible 84 An example for a matrix in block-
</p>
<p>diagonal form is
</p>
<p>⎛
⎝
</p>
<p>a b 0
c d 0
0 0 e
</p>
<p>⎞
⎠.
</p>
<p>representation can be rewritten in block-diagonal form through sim-
</p>
<p>ilarity transformations. These notions are important because we use
</p>
<p>irreducible representations to describe elementary particles85. We will
85 What else?see later that the behavior of elementary particles under transforma-
</p>
<p>tions is described by irreducible representations of the corresponding
</p>
<p>symmetry group.
</p>
<p>There are many possible representations for each group86, how do 86 For example we already know two
different representations for rotations
in two-dimensions. One using complex
numbers and one using 2&times; 2 matrices.
Both are representations of S1 as a
group.
</p>
<p>we know which one to choose to describe nature? There is an idea
</p>
<p>that is based on the Casimir elements. A Casimir element C is built
</p>
<p>from generators of the Lie algebra and its defining feature is that it
</p>
<p>commutes with every generator X of the group
</p>
<p>[C, X] = 0. (3.92)
</p>
<p>What does this mean? A famous Lemma, called Schur&rsquo;s Lemma87, 87 A basic result of group theory, which
you can look up in any book about
group theory. For example, Schur&rsquo;s
lemma is proven at page 239 in Nadir
Jeevanjee. An Introduction to Tensors and
Group Theory for Physicists. Birkhaeuser,
1st edition, August 2011. ISBN 978-
0817647148.
</p>
<p>tells us that if we have an irreducible representation R : g &rarr; GL(V),
any linear operator T : V &rarr; V that commutes with all operators
R(X) must be a scalar multiple of the identity operator. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the Casimir elements give us linear operators with constant values
</p>
<p>for each representation. As we will see, these values provide us with
</p>
<p>a way of labelling representations naturally.88 We can therefore start
88 This will become much clearer as
soon as we look at an example.to investigate the irreducible representations, by starting with the
</p>
<p>representation with the lowest possible scalar value for the Casimir

<p>54 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>in the definition of a representation above? An important observation
</p>
<p>that helps us to make sense of the vector space, is that for any Lie
</p>
<p>group, one or several of the corresponding generators can be diag-
</p>
<p>onalized using similarity transformations. In physics we use these
</p>
<p>diagonal generators to get labels for the basis vectors that span our
</p>
<p>vector space. We use the eigenvectors of these diagonal generators
</p>
<p>as basis for our vector space and the corresponding eigenvalues as
</p>
<p>labels. This idea is incredibly important to actually understand the
</p>
<p>physical implications of a given group. If there is just one gener-
</p>
<p>ator that can be diagonalized simultaneously, each basis vector is
</p>
<p>labelled by just one number: the corresponding eigenvalue. If there
</p>
<p>are several generators that can be diagonalized simultaneously, we
</p>
<p>get several numbers as labels for each basic vector. Each such number
</p>
<p>is simply the eigenvalue of a given diagonal generator that belongs
</p>
<p>to this basic vector (=eigenvector). In particular this is where the
</p>
<p>"charge labels" for elementary particles: electric charge, weak charge,
</p>
<p>color charge, come from. This idea will make a lot more sense, once
</p>
<p>we are ready to look at some explicit examples89.
</p>
<p>89 A bit more background information:
The set of diagonal generators is called
Cartan subalgebra, and the correspond-
ing generators Cartan generators. As
already mentioned, these generators
play a big role in elementary particle
physics, because the eigenvalues of
the Cartan generators are used to give
charge labels to elementary particles.
For example, to derive quantum chro-
modynamics, we use the group SU(3),
as we will see later, and there are two
SU(3) Cartan generators. Therefore,
each particle that interacts via chromo-
dynamics, carries two charge labels.
Conventionally instead of writing two
numbers, one uses the words red, blue,
green, and calls the corresponding
charge colour. Analogous, the theory of
weak interactions uses the group SU(2),
which has only one Cartan generator.
Therefore, each particle is labelled by
the corresponding eigenvalue of this
Cartan generator.
</p>
<p>In the next sections, we will derive the irreducible representations
</p>
<p>of the Lie algebra of SU(2), because, as we will see, the Lie algebra
</p>
<p>of the Lorentz group can be thought of as two copies of the algebra
</p>
<p>su(2)90. The Lorentz group is part of the Poincar&eacute; group and there-
</p>
<p>90 Technically it&rsquo;s the complexification of
the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group
that can be understood as two copies
of the complexification of the Lie algebra
su(2).
</p>
<p>fore we will talk about these groups in this order.
</p>
<p>3.6 SU(2)
</p>
<p>We used in Section 3.4.3 specific matrices (=a specific representation)
</p>
<p>to identify how the generators of SU(2) behave, when put into the
</p>
<p>Lie bracket91. We can use this knowledge to find further represen-

</p>
<p>tations. Unsurprisingly, we will derive again the representation that
</p>
<p>we started with, i.e. the set of unitary 2&times; 2 matrices with unit deter-
minant. However, we are then able to see that this is just one special
</p>
<p>case. Before we tackle this task, we want to take a moment to think
</p>
<p>about what representations we can expect.
</p>
<p>3.6.1 The Finite-dimensional Irreducible Representations
</p>
<p>of SU(2)
</p>
<p>As noted earlier, there are special operators that we can build from
</p>
<p>a given set of generators that are useful to understand the repre-
</p>
<p>sentations of the Lie algebra in question. These operators are called
</p>
<p>Casimir operators and have the special property that they commute
</p>
<p>with all generators of the given Lie algebra. For the Lie algebra su(2)
</p>
<p>there is one such operator9292 We restrict ourselves here to quadratic
Casimir operators, which means opera-
tors that are quadratic in the generators.
There are also higher order Casimir
operators, but here we always mean
quadratic Casimir operators.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, let&rsquo;s consider again the 3-dimensional represen-
</p>
<p>tation93, as shown in Eq. 3.86. For, this representation the Casimir 93 So far, we have not discussed where
this representation comes from. We will
understand this in a moment. Here we
only use the final result to explain the
basic idea behind the use of the Casimir
operator J2.

<p>2 0 0
</p>
<p>0 2 0
</p>
<p>0 0 2
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ . (3.94)
</p>
<p>In other words, the Casimir operator is simply two times the 3&times; 3
identity matrix. In contrast, for the 2-dimensional representation, as
</p>
<p>given by Ji =
1
2σi, where σi are the Pauli matrices (Eq. 3.80), we get
</p>
<p>J22-dim =
</p>
<p>(
3
4 0
</p>
<p>0 34
</p>
<p>)
. (3.95)
</p>
<p>This illustrates that if the generators J1, J2, J3 are given in some rep-
</p>
<p>resentation, we can calculate the corresponding Casimir operator
</p>
<p>explicitly. If we act with this Casimir operator on any element of
</p>
<p>the vector space that our generators act on94, we get a number. This 94 Recall that a representation is a map
of the abstract group or Lie algebra
elements to the linear operators that act
on some vector space.
</p>
<p>number is what we use to label different representations.
</p>
<p>In addition to this label for different representations, we use addi-
</p>
<p>tional special operators to label the different elements of the vector
</p>
<p>space that our groups acts on. The operators we use for this purpose
</p>
<p>are known as Cartan elements of the Lie algebra. In other words,
</p>
<p>while Casimir elements operators provide labels for different repre-
</p>
<p>sentations, the Cartan element provide labels within a given repre-
</p>
<p>sentation. The Cartan elements are all those generators that can be
</p>
<p>diagonalized simultaneously. For su(2) there is only one such ele-
</p>
<p>ment and it is conventional to choose J3 as diagonal generator
95. In 95 As noted above, for other algebras
</p>
<p>like su(3), there is more than one
Cartan element and therefore we get
multiple labels for each vector.
</p>
<p>the 3-dimensional representation (Eq. 3.86) it is given by

<p>J3 =

<p>0 0 0
</p>
<p>0 0 &minus;1
</p>

<p>and in the 2-dimensional representation it is given by

<p>J3 =
</p>
<p>(
1
2 0
</p>
<p>0 &minus; 12
</p>
<p>)
. (3.97)
</p>
<p>We use for each representation the eigenvectors of the diagonal gen-
</p>
<p>erator J3 as basis vectors for the vector space that our representation
</p>
<p>acts on. This means that every such basis vector is labeled by two
</p>
<p>numbers96 96 We use here an abstract notation for
the elements of the vector space that
our generators act on. This notations
emphasizes the labels that we use to
distinguish different elements and
is extremely popular in quantum
mechanics, as will be discussed in
Section 8.5.3.

</p>
<p>After this preliminary discussion we are finally ready to under-
</p>
<p>stand the representations of SU(2). To learn something about what
</p>
<p>finite-dimensional, irreducible representations of SU(2) are possible,
</p>
<p>we define new operators from the ones we used in Section 3.4.3:99
</p>
<p>99 Take note that we use a complex lin-
ear combination here. This process of
considering a complex linear combina-
tion, instead of the original generators
is called a complexification, because
usually we only allow real linear combi-
nations of the generators. So from here
on, we consider the complexification
of the Lie algebra su(2), which is also
called sl(2,C).
</p>
<p>J+ = J1 + i J2 (3.99)
</p>
<p>J&minus; = J1 &minus; i J2 . (3.100)
</p>
<p>These new operators obey the following commutation relations, as
</p>
<p>you can check by using the commutator relations in Eq. 3.82100
</p>
<p>100 We can always diagonalize one of
the generators. As mentioned above,
we choose J3 as diagonal and therefore
yielding the basis vectors for our vector
space.
</p>
<p>[J3, J&plusmn;] = &plusmn;J&plusmn; (3.101)
[J+, J&minus;] = 2J3. (3.102)
</p>
<p>If we now investigate how these operators act on an eigenvector
</p>
<p>|b,m〉 of J3 with eigenvalue101 m, we discover something remarkable:
</p>
<p>101 This means J3 |b,m〉 = m |b,m〉 as
explained in Appendix C.4.
</p>
<p>J3(J&plusmn; |b,m〉) = J3(J&plusmn; |b,m〉) + J&plusmn; J3 |b,m〉 &minus; J&plusmn; J3 |b,m〉︸ ︷︷ ︸

</p>
<p>=︸︷︷︸
Eq. 3.101
</p>
<p>(m &plusmn; 1)J&plusmn; |b,m〉 . (3.103)
</p>
<p>We conclude that J&plusmn; |b,m〉 is again an eigenvector of J3, but with
eigenvalue (m &plusmn; 1) and thus we write102 J&plusmn; |b,m〉 &equiv; C |b,m &plusmn; 1〉:102 To be general, we include here
</p>
<p>a constant C. This constant will be
discussed in a moment.
</p>
<p>J3 |b,m &plusmn; 1〉 = (m &plusmn; 1) |b,m &plusmn; 1〉 . (3.104)
</p>
<p>The operators J&minus; and J+ are called raising and lowering opera-
tors or ladder operators. Starting from one J3 eigenvector, we can
</p>
<p>construct more and more J3 eigenvectors using the ladder operators
</p>
<p>J&plusmn; repeatedly. This process must come to an end, because eigenvec-
tors with different eigenvalues are linearly independent and we are
</p>
<p>dealing with finite-dimensional representations. This means that the
</p>
<p>corresponding vector space is finite-dimensional and therefore we
</p>
<p>can only find a finite number of linearly independent vectors.</p>

</p>
<p>We conclude that there must be an eigenvector with a maximum

<p>have

<p>J+ |b, j〉 = 0 , (3.105)
</p>
<p>because the only other possibility would be that, according to Eq. 3.103,

<p>we produce a new eigenvector with eigenvalue j + 1 and thus j
</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be the maximum eigenvalue. We can calculate a relation-

</p>
<p>Therefore, we can conclude b &minus; j2 &minus; j = 0 and thus
</p>
<p>b = j(j + 1) . (3.108)
</p>
<p>Completely analogous to how we concluded that there is an eigen-
</p>
<p>vector of J3 with maximum eigenvalue j, we can conclude that there
</p>
<p>is an eigenvector with minimal eigenvalue. We call this minimal
</p>
<p>eigenvalue k and we must have J&minus; |b, k〉 = 0, because otherwise k
would not be the minimal eigenvalue. Analogous to the calculation
</p>
<p>in Eq. 3.107, we can calculate
</p>
<p>0 = J+ J&minus; |b, k〉 = (b &minus; k2 + k) |b, k〉 . (3.109)
</p>
<p>Therefore, we have (b &minus; k2 + k) = 0 and can conclude
</p>
<p>b = &minus;k(&minus;k + 1) . (3.110)
</p>
<p>By comparing Eq. 3.108 with Eq. 3.110, we can conclude
</p>
<p>k = &minus;j . (3.111)
</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to recall our discussion from the beginning of this
</p>
<p>section. We have one label b coming from the quadratic Casimir op-
</p>
<p>erator J2, which we use to distinguish different representations. In
</p>
<p>addition, we have another label m coming from the diagonal gener-
</p>
<p>ator J3, which we use to label different elements of the vector space
</p>
<p>our representation acts on. We have derived above that for finite di-
</p>
<p>mensional representations, there is a maximal value for m, which</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>58 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>we called j. We introduced ladder operators J&plusmn; that act on a given
|b,m〉 and yield a new eigenvector of J3 with eigenvalue m &plusmn; 1. In
practice, this means we can start with the eigenvector with maxi-
</p>
<p>mum J3 eigenvalue |b, j〉 for a given representation and then "move
down the ladder" using J&minus;. The repeated application of J&minus; yields
new eigenvectors of J3. However, this process must come to an end
</p>
<p>at some eigenvector |b, k〉 with lowest J3 eigenvalue k, because we are
dealing with a finite dimensional representation and there can not be
</p>
<p>infinitely many eigenvectors. Acting with J&minus; on this eigenvector with
minimal eigenvalue |b, k〉 yields simply zero. We calculated that this
minimal eigenvalue is k = &minus;j.
</p>
<p>In summary, for each SU(2) representation, labeled by b = j(j +
</p>
<p>1) (Eq. 3.108), we get a set of J3 eigenvectors with integer spaced
</p>
<p>eigenvalues in the range &minus;j &le; m &le; j. As mentioned above, we can
start climbing down the ladder at the vector |b, j〉 with maximum J3
eigenvalue and get to the vector with minimum eigenvalue |b,&minus;j〉 by
repeated application of the operator J&minus;. After each application the
eigenvalue is lowered by one. Therefore, the difference between the
</p>
<p>maximum J3 eigenvalue j and the minimal value &minus;j is an integer:
j &minus; (&minus;j) = integer. From this we can conclude immediately
</p>
<p>2j = integer &rarr; j = integer
2
</p>
<p>. (3.112)
</p>
<p>This is an incredibly important insight, because it allows us to under-
</p>
<p>stand the possible finite-dimensional representations of su(2). If we
</p>
<p>simply start plugging in the allowed values of j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . .,
</p>
<p>we get all possible su(2) representations. In addition, we can use
</p>
<p>what learned above to understand and construct these representa-
</p>
<p>tions explicitly. This explicit construction will be the topic of the next
</p>
<p>sections. It is particular instructive to have a look at the possible J3
eigenvalues m for the different allowed values of j and the value of
</p>
<p>the quadratic Casimir operator J2 for these representations104104 In Eq. 3.98 we called the eigenvalue
that belongs to J2 simply b. However in
Eq. 3.108, we calculated that we express
b through the maximum J3 eigenvalue
that we called j: b = j(j + 1). j = 0 , m = 0 , j(j + 1) = 0
</p>
<p>j = 1/2 , m = 1/2,&minus;1/2 , j(j + 1) = 3/4
j = 1 , m = 1, 0, 1 , j(j + 1) = 2
</p>
<p>j = 3/2 , m = 3/2, 1/2,&minus;1/2,&minus;3/2 , j(j + 1) = 15/4
. . . (3.113)
</p>
<p>We learn here that the j = 0 representation is one-dimensional, the
</p>
<p>j = 1/2 representation is two-dimensional, the j = 1 representa-
</p>
<p>tion is three-dimensional and the j = 3/2 representation is four-
</p>
<p>dimensional105. Take note that the values for the quadratic Casimir105 We use the eigenvectors of the Cartan
generator, here J3, as basis vectors for
the vector space that our representation
acts on. For example, if there are two
possible eigenvalues of J3, i.e. m values,
we have two basis vectors and thus
the corresponding representation is
two-dimensional.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>operator J2 for the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional repre-
</p>
<p>sentation are exactly those that we calculated at the beginning of this
</p>
<p>section.
</p>
<p>There is one more thing we need to discuss, before we can move
</p>
<p>on to the actual explicit construction of these various representations.
</p>
<p>We calculated in Eq. 3.103 that if we act with J+ on a given J3 eigen-
</p>
<p>vector |b,m〉, we get a new J3 eigenvector with a higher eigenvalue:
J3 J+ |b,m〉 = (m + 1)J+ |b,m〉. However, we can not simply conclude
that J+ |b,m〉 = |b,m + 1〉. Instead, we only know that J+ |b,m〉 is
proportional to |b,m + 1〉 and therefore we write
</p>
<p>J+ |b,m〉 = C |b,m + 1〉 , (3.114)
</p>
<p>where C is some constant. We now want to calculate this constant,
</p>
<p>because only then we have fully understood the action of the ladder
</p>
<p>operators and can actually use them to construct the representations
</p>
<p>explicitly. The thing is that we want to work with normalized basis
</p>
<p>vectors and hence want that |b,m〉 and |b,m + 1〉 are normalized:
</p>
<p>|b,m〉&dagger; |b,m〉 = 1
|b,m + 1〉&dagger; |b,m + 1〉 = 1 . (3.115)
</p>
<p>If we act with J+ or equally with J&minus; on a normalized basis vector like
|b,m〉 the result will be, in general, not normalized. If we wouldn&rsquo;t
care about normalization, we could write J+ |b,m〉 = |b,m + 1〉. How-
ever, for us a basis vector like |b,m + 1〉 means always a normalized
basis vector and hence we need to include the additional constant C.
</p>
<p>From the definition106 of J&minus; and J+ it follows that J&dagger;&minus; = J+ and 106 Eq. 3.99 and Eq. 3.100:
J+ =

(J1 + i J2) and

J&dagger;+ = J&minus;. Thus if we calculate the norm

<p>equivalent to one of these that we can construct by using the tools de-
</p>
<p>scribed above109. There is one small thing we need to discuss before109 See, for example, page 190 in: Nadir

<p>we move on. The label j(j + 1) takes a lot of space and is somewhat
</p>
<p>redundant. It is therefore conventional to use simply j as a label in-
</p>
<p>stead. This means, we use |j,m〉 instead of |j(j + 1),m〉.
</p>
<p>Now we look at specific examples for the representations. We start,
</p>
<p>of course, with the lowest dimensional representation.</p>

<p>3.6.2 The Representation of SU(2) in one Dimension
</p>
<p>The lowest possible value for j is zero. As already mentioned above,
</p>
<p>this representation acts on a one-dimensional vector space. We can
</p>
<p>see that this representation is trivial, because the only 1 &times; 1 "ma-
trix" that fulfills the commutation relations of the SU(2) Lie algebra
</p>
<p>[Jl , Jm] = iǫlmn Jn, are the number 0. If we exponentiate the generator
</p>
<p>0, we always get the transformation U = e0 = 1, which changes
</p>
<p>nothing at all.
</p>
<p>3.6.3 The Representation of SU(2) in two Dimensions
</p>
<p>We now take a look at the next possible value j = 12 . This representa-
</p>
<p>tion is 2 12 + 1 = 2 dimensional
110. The generator J3 has eigenvalues
</p>
<p>1

</p>
<p>110 See Eq. 3.113.
</p>
<p>and 12 &minus; 1 = &minus; 12 , as can be seen from Eq. 3.113 and is therefore given
by

1 0
</p>

</p>
<p>)
, (3.121)
</p>
<p>because we choose J3 to be the diagonal generator
111. The eigenvec- 111 For SU(2) only one generator is
</p>
<p>diagonal, because of the commutation
relations. Furthermore, remember that
we are able to transform the generators
using similarity transformations and
could therefore easily make another
generator diagonal.
</p>
<p>tors corresponding to the eigenvalues + 12 and &minus; 12 are112
</p>
<p>112 As mentioned above, we use, for
brevity, |j,m〉 instead of |j(j + 1),m〉.
Here j = 1/2.

<p>used there was exactly this two dimensional representation. Never-
</p>
<p>theless, there are many more, for example, in three-dimensions as we
</p>
<p>will see in the next section114.114 Again, don&rsquo;t get confused by the
name SU(2), which we originally de-
fined as the set of unitary 2&times; 2 matrices
with unit determinant. Here we mean
the abstract group, defined by the cor-
responding manifold S3 and we are
going to talk about higher dimensional
representations of this group, which
result in, for example, a representation
with 3&times; 3 matrices. It would help if
we could give this structure a different
name (For example, using the name of
the corresponding manifold S3), but
unfortunately SU(2) is the conventional
name.
</p>
<p>3.6.4 The Representation of SU(2) in three Dimensions
</p>
<p>Following the same procedure115 as in two-dimensions, we find:
</p>
<p>115 Again we start with the diagonal
generator J3, which we can write down
immediately because we know its
eigenvalues (1, 0,&minus;1) from Eq. 3.113.
Afterwards, the other two generators
J1, J2 can be derived by looking at how
they act on the basis vectors, i.e. the
eigenvectors of J3. To calculate this, we
use again that we can write J1 and J2 in
terms of J&plusmn;.

</p>
<p>In this section we will derive one well-known representation of
</p>
<p>the Lorentz group. Then we will use this familiar representation to
</p>
<p>derive the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. This is exactly the same
</p>
<p>route we followed for SU(2). There we started with explicit 2&times; 2 ma-
trices to derive the corresponding Lie algebra. We will find that the
</p>
<p>complexified Lie algebra of the Lorentz group consists of two copies
</p>
<p>of the Lie algebra su(2). This fact can be used to discover further
</p>
<p>representations of the Lorentz group, whereas the well-known vec-
</p>
<p>tor representation, which is the representation of the Lorentz group
</p>
<p>by 4&times; 4 matrices acting on four-vectors, will prove to be one of the
representations. The new representations will provide us with tools
</p>
<p>to describe physical systems that cannot be described by the vector
</p>
<p>representation. This shows the power of Lie theory. Using Lie theory
</p>
<p>we are able to identify the hidden abstract structure of a symmetry
</p>
<p>and by using this knowledge, we are able to describe nature at the
</p>
<p>most fundamental level with the required tools.
</p>
<p>We start with a characterisation of the Lorentz group and its sub-
</p>
<p>groups. The Lorentz group is the set of all transformations that pre-
</p>
<p>serve the inner product of Minkowski space117 117 This was derived in Chapter 2. Recall
that this definition is analogous to
our definition of rotations and spatial
reflections in Euclidean space, which
preserve the inner product of Euclidean
space.

<p>ν = (x0)2 &minus; (x1)2 &minus; (x2)2 &minus; (x3)2 (3.130)

</p>
<p>This is the reason why we call the Lorentz group O(1, 3). The group
</p>
<p>O(4) preserves (x0)2+ (x1)2+ (x2)2+ (x3)2. Let&rsquo;s see what restriction
</p>
<p>this imposes. The conventional name for a Lorentz transformation is
</p>
<p>Λ ("lambda"). For the moment, Λ is just a name and we will derive
</p>
<p>now how these transformations look like explicitly. If we transform
</p>
<p>xμ &rarr; x&prime;μ = Λμν xν, we get the product
</p>
<p>xμημνx

</p>
<p>!

<p>and because this must hold for arbitrary xμ we conclude

</p>
<p>or written in matrix form118 118 Recall that in order to write the prod-

the left vector is transposed. Therefore
we get here ΛT .

</p>
<p>This is how the Lorentz transformations Λ are defined!
</p>
<p>Starting from this definition, we will now derive a useful classifica-
</p>
<p>tion for all Lorentz transformations.
</p>
<p>If we take the determinant of Eq. 3.133 and use det(AB) = det(A)det(B),

<p>we get the condition

Furthermore, if we look at the μ = ν = 0 component in Eq. 3.133119,119 We will see in a minute why this is

2. (3.138)
</p>
<p>We now divide the Lorentz transformations into four "sub-categories",
</p>
<p>depending on the signs in Eq. 3.136 and Eq. 3.138:
</p>
<p>L&uarr;+ : det(Λ) = +1; Λ
0
0 &ge; 1
</p>
<p>L&uarr;&minus; : det(Λ) = &minus;1; Λ00 &ge; 1
L&darr;+ : det(Λ) = +1; Λ

<p>0
0 &le; &minus;1
</p>
<p>L&darr;&minus; : det(Λ) = &minus;1; Λ00 &le; &minus;1 . (3.139)
</p>
<p>This classification is useful, because, as we will see in a moment, only
</p>
<p>the transformations in one of these categories120, L&uarr;+, can be gen-120 The technical term for this most
important category L&uarr;+ is proper,
orthochronous Lorentz group. "Proper"
refers to the property det (Λ) = +1,
which in physical terms means that
transformations in this category do
not change the spatial orientation. For
example, a right-handed coordinate
system stays right-handed and does not
become a left-handed one. The word
"orthochronous" refers to the property
Λ00 &ge; 1 and means in physical terms
that transformations with this property
do not change the direction of time.
</p>
<p>erated through infinitesimal transformations. We, want to use the
</p>
<p>power of Lie theory and in particular learn as much as possible from
</p>
<p>the Lie algebra that belongs to a given group. Thus we focus on this
</p>
<p>sub-category L&uarr;+ and try to learn as much as possible using the cor-
responding generators. The transformations in the other categories
</p>
<p>are a combination of the transformations in this special category and
</p>
<p>one or both of two special transformations known as time-reversal
</p>
<p>ΛT and space-inversion ΛP, where
121
</p>
<p>121 At least for one representation, these
operators look like this. We will see
later that for different representations,
these operators look quite different.
The subscript P here denotes "parity"
which is another name for space-
inversion. In physical terms a parity
transformation is a reflection at the
spatial axes, whereas a time-reversal
transformation is a reflection at the time
axis.

</p>
<p>This is illustrated in figure 3.8. In this sense, we can understand the
</p>
<p>complete Lorentz group as the set
</p>
<p>O(1, 3) = {L&uarr;+,ΛPL&uarr;+,ΛT L&uarr;+,ΛPΛT L&uarr;+}. (3.142)
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.8: The four components of the
Lorentz group are connected through
the two discrete transformations known
as time-reversal ΛT and space-inversion
ΛP.
</p>
<p>So, why can only transformations in the L&uarr;+ category be built up
by infinitesimal transformations? The transformations that can be
</p>
<p>built up by infinitesimal transformations are smoothly connected to
</p>
<p>the identity transformation, because the infinitesimal transformations
</p>
<p>are infinitesimally close to the identity element. Therefore, the iden-
</p>
<p>tity element is in the same category as all the transformations that
</p>
<p>can be built up by repeating infinitesimal ones. We have
</p>
<p>det(Id) = +1; Id00 = 1
</p>
<p>and therefore the identity transformation and with it all transforma-
</p>
<p>tions that can be generated through infinitesimal transformations,
</p>
<p>belong to the L&uarr;+ category.
</p>
<p>An important related observation is that the four categories that
</p>
<p>we defined above: L&uarr;+, L
&uarr;
&minus;, L
</p>
<p>&darr;
+, L
</p>
<p>&darr;
&minus;, are not smoothly connected to
</p>
<p>each other. For example, there is a "gap" between the transforma-
</p>
<p>tions with det(Λ) = +1 and those with det(Λ) = &minus;1. There are no
transformations in between. Equally, there is a "gap" between Λ00 &ge; 1
and Λ00 &le; &minus;1 and also no transformations in between. The jump
across this gap can only be achieved by making use of the discrete
</p>
<p>transformations ΛP and ΛT . Therefore, the transformations in the
</p>
<p>other categories are not smoothly connected to the identity element,
</p>
<p>which is part of the L&uarr;+ category. For this reason, we can not get the
transformations in these other categories, by solely using infinitesi-
</p>
<p>mal transformations. Instead, we always need the discrete "jumps"
</p>
<p>provided by ΛP and ΛT .
</p>
<p>To summarize: We concentrate in the following on the transforma-
</p>
<p>tions in the L&uarr;+ subcategory, because it contains all transformations
that can be built up by repeating infinitesimal ones. Such transforma-
</p>
<p>tions are especially nice, because we can understand them through
</p>
<p>the corresponding Lie algebra. In practice this means that in the next
</p>
<p>step, we investigate the generators122 that generate all transforma- 122 Recall: Generators are the elements
of the Lie algebra.tions in the L&uarr;+ category. The transformations in the other categories
</p>
<p>are simply a combination of the transformations that we derive this
</p>
<p>way, and the discrete operations ΛP and ΛT .</p>

Minkowski space R(1,3). We will look

space first, because the Lorentz group
is defined there in the first place, i.e. as
the set of transformations that preserve
the 4&times; 4 metric. Equivalently SU(2)
was defined as complex 2&times; 2 matrices
in the first place and we tried to learn
as much as possible about SU(2) from
these matrices, in order to derive other
representations later .
</p>
<p>given by real 4&times; 4 matrices. The matrices must be real, because we
want to know how they act on elements of the real Minkowski space
</p>
<p>R(1,3). A generic, real 4&times; 4 matrix has 16 parameters. The defining
condition of the Lorentz group, which is in fact 10 conditions124, re-
</p>
<p>124 You can see this, by putting a generic
4&times; 4 matrix Λ, in ΛTηΛ = η.
</p>
<p>stricts this to 6 parameters. In other words, to describe a most general
</p>
<p>Lorentz transformation, 6 parameters are needed. Therefore, if we
</p>
<p>find 6 linearly independent generators, we have found a complete
</p>
<p>basis for the Lie algebra of this group. This means every other gener-
</p>
<p>ator can be written as a linear combination of these basis generators.
</p>
<p>In addition, we are then able to compute how these basis genera-
</p>
<p>tors behave when put into the Lie bracket and therefore to derive the
</p>
<p>abstract definition of this Lie algebra.
</p>
<p>First note that the rotation matrices of 3-dimensional Euclidean
</p>
<p>space, which involve only space and leave the time unchanged, fulfil
</p>
<p>the condition in Eq. 3.133125. This follows because the spatial part126125 ΛσμησρΛ

</p>

</p>
<p>126 The spatial part are the components
μ = 1, 2, 3. Commonly this is denoted
by ηij, because Latin indices, like i, j
always run from 1 to 3 and Greek
indices, like μ and ν, run from 0 to 3.
</p>
<p>of the Minkowski metric is proportional to the 3 &times; 3 identity ma-
trix127 and therefore for transformations involving only space, we
</p>
<p>127 Recall η11 = η22 = η33 = &minus;1 and
ηij = 0 for i �= j.
</p>
<p>have from Eq. 3.133 the condition
</p>
<p>&minus;RT I3&times;3R = &minus;RT R != &minus;I3&times;3
</p>
<p>&rarr; RT I3&times;3R = RT R != I3&times;3.
</p>
<p>This is exactly the defining condition of O(3). Together with the
</p>
<p>condition (Eq. 3.139)
</p>
<p>det(Λ)
!
= 1
</p>
<p>these are the defining conditions of SO(3). We conclude that the

which reads in matrix form129 129 Recall that the first index denotes

<p>the row and the second the column.
So far we have been a little sloppy
with first and second index, by writ-

have K

<p>μ
ρ &equiv; Kμρ &rarr; (KT)μρ = K μρ .

<p>Matrix multiplication always works
by multiplying rows with columns.
Therefore Kνσηρν = ηρνK

<p>the ρ-row of η is multiplied with the
σ-column of K. This term then is in
matrix notation ηK. Furthermore,

<p>to write this index term in matrix nota-
tion we need to use the transpose of K,
because only then we get a product of
the form row times column. The ρ-row
of KT is multiplied with the σ-column
of η. Therefore, this term is KTη in ma-

Now we have the condition for the generators of transformations
</p>
<p>involving time and space. A transformation generated by these gen-
</p>
<p>erators is called a boost. A boost means a change into a coordinate
</p>
<p>system that moves with a different constant velocity compared with
</p>
<p>the original coordinate system. We can boost the description that we
</p>
<p>have, for example in a frame of reference where the object in ques-
</p>
<p>tion is at rest, into a frame of reference where it moves relative to
</p>
<p>the observer. Let&rsquo;s go back to the example used in Chapter 2.1: A

<p>closed under commutation136, the boost generators are not137. We 136 Closed under commutation means
that the commutator [Ji , Jj] = Ji Jj &minus; Jj Ji ,
is again a rotation generator. From
Eq. 3.165 we can see that this is the
case.

<p>137 Eq. 3.167 tells us that the commutator

recall that this process of considering
a complex linear combination, instead
of the original generators is called a
complexification. Usually we only
allow real linear combinations of
the generators. So from here on, we
consider the complexification of the Lie

<p>[N+i , N

</p>
<p>These are precisely the commutation relations for the Lie algebra of
</p>
<p>SU(2) and we have therefore discovered that the complexified Lie
</p>
<p>algebra of L&uarr;+ consists of two copies of the Lie algebra su(2)
139. 139 Recall that when we discussed
</p>
<p>the representations of the Lie al-
gebra su(2), we also used the cor-
responding complexification. The
complexification of su(2) is sl(2,C)
and therefore technically we have
so(1, 3)C &sim;= sl(2,C) &oplus; sl(2,C), where
so(1, 3)C denotes the complexification
of the Lorentz group Lie algebra.
</p>
<p>This is great news, because we already know how to construct
</p>
<p>all irreducible representations of the Lie algebra of su(2). However
</p>
<p>we must be careful. The Lorentz group is, like SO(3), not simply-
</p>
<p>connected140 and Lie theory tells us that, for groups that aren&rsquo;t sim-
</p>
<p>140 We will use this simply as a fact here,
because a proof would lead us too far
apart.
</p>
<p>ply connected, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the
</p>
<p>irreducible representations of the Lie algebra and representations of
</p>
<p>the corresponding group141. Instead, by deriving the irreducible
</p>
<p>141 This can be quite confusing, but
remember that there is always one
distinguished group that belongs to a
Lie algebra. This group is distinguished
because it is simply connected. If we
derive the irreducible representation
of a Lie algebra, we get, by putting
those Lie algebra elements (= the
generators) in the exponential function,
representations of the simply connected
(= covering) group. Only for the simply
connected group there is a one-to-one
correspondence.
</p>
<p>representations of the complexified Lie algebra of the Lorentz
</p>
<p>group, we find the irreducible representations of the covering
</p>
<p>group of the Lorentz group, if we put the corresponding genera-
</p>
<p>tors into the exponential function. Some of these representations will
</p>
<p>be representations of the Lorentz group, but we will find more than
</p>
<p>that. This is good, because we need these additional representations
</p>
<p>to describe certain elementary particles.</p>

</p>
<p>For brevity, we will continue to call the representations we will derive,
</p>
<p>representations of the Lorentz group instead of representations of the Lie
</p>
<p>algebra of the Lorentz group or representations of the double cover of the
</p>
<p>Lorentz group.
</p>
<p>Each irreducible representation of the Lie algebra su(2) can be
</p>
<p>labeled by the scalar value j of the su(2) Casimir operator142. There-142 To be precise: the scalar value that
we get from the quadratic Casimir
operator is j(j + 1). However, for
brevity, we simply use j instead.
</p>
<p>fore, we now know that we can label the irreducible representations
</p>
<p>of the covering group143 of the Lorentz group by two integer or half
</p>
<p>143 The covering group of the proper
</p>
<p>orthochronous Lorentz group L&uarr;+ is
SL(2,C), which is defined as the set of
2&times; 2 matrices with unit determinant
and complex entries. The relationship
</p>
<p>SL(2,C) &rarr; L&uarr;+ &equiv; SO(1, 3)&uarr;+ is similar
to the relationship SU(2) &rarr; SO(3) we
discovered earlier in this text.
</p>
<p>integer numbers: j1 and j2. This means we will look at the (j1, j2) rep-
</p>
<p>resentations and use the j1, j2 = 0,
1
2 , 1 . . . representations for the two
</p>
<p>su(2) copies, which we derived earlier.
</p>
<p>It is conventional to write the Lorentz algebra in a more compact
</p>
<p>way by introducing a new symbol Mμν, which is defined through the
</p>
<p>equations
</p>
<p>Ji =
1
</p>
<p>2
ǫijk Mjk. (3.173)
</p>
<p>Ki = M0i . (3.174)
</p>
<p>With this new definition the Lorentz algebra reads
</p>
<p>[Mμν, Mρσ] = i(ημρMνσ &minus; ημσMνρ &minus; ηνρMμσ + ηνσMμρ). (3.175)
</p>
<p>Next, we investigate different representations of the complexified Lie
</p>
<p>algebra of the Lorentz group and hence of the double cover of the
</p>
<p>Lorentz group in detail.
</p>
<p>3.7.4 The (0, 0) Representation
</p>
<p>The lowest dimensional representation is, as it is for SU(2), trivial,
</p>
<p>because the vector space is one-dimensional for both copies of su(2).
</p>
<p>Our generators must therefore be 1&times; 1 matrices and the only 1&times; 1
"matrix" that fulfills the commutation relations is the number 0:
</p>
<p>N+i = N
&minus;
i = 0 &rarr; eiN
</p>
<p>+
i = eiN
</p>
<p>&minus;
i = e0 = 1 (3.176)
</p>
<p>Therefore we conclude that the (0, 0) representation of the Lorentz
</p>
<p>group acts on objects that do not change under Lorentz transforma-
</p>
<p>tions. This representation is called the scalar representation.
</p>
<p>3.7.5 The (12 , 0) Representation
</p>
<p>In this representation we use the144 2 dimensional representation144 Recall that the dimension of our vec-
tor space is given by 2j + 1. Therefore
we have here 2 12 + 1 = 2 dimensions.
</p>
<p>for one copy of the SU(2) Lie algebra N+i , i.e. N

i =

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lie group theory 73
</p>
<p>dimensional representation for the other N&minus;i , i.e. N
&minus;
i = 0. From the
</p>
<p>definition of N&minus; in Eq. 3.169 we conclude
</p>
<p>N&minus;i =
1
</p>
<p>2
(Ji &minus; iKi) = 0 (3.177)
</p>
<p>&rarr; Ji = iKi. (3.178)
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can use that we already derived in Section 3.6.3 the
</p>
<p>two dimensional representation of SU(2):
</p>
<p>N+i =
σi
2
, (3.179)
</p>
<p>where σi denotes once more the Pauli matrices, which were defined
</p>
<p>in Eq. 3.80. On the other hand, we have
</p>
<p>N+i =︸︷︷︸
Eq. 3.169

</p>
<p>2
(Ji + iKi) =︸︷︷︸
</p>
<p>Eq. 3.178
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
(iKi + iKi) = iKi (3.180)
</p>
<p>Comparing Eq. 3.179 with Eq. 3.180 tells us that
</p>
<p>iKi =
σi
2
</p>
<p>&rarr; Ki =
σi

&minus;i2
2
</p>
<p>σi =
1
</p>
<p>2
σi. (3.182)
</p>
<p>We conclude that a Lorentz rotation in this representation is given by
</p>
<p>Rθ = e
i�θ&middot;�J = ei�θ&middot;
</p>
<p>�σ
2 (3.183)
</p>
<p>and a Lorentz boost by
</p>
<p>Bφ = e
i�φ&middot;�K = e�φ&middot;
</p>
<p>�σ
2 . (3.184)
</p>
<p>By writing out the exponential function as series expansion we can
</p>
<p>easily get the representation of the double cover of the Lorentz group
</p>
<p>from the representation of the generators. For example, rotations
</p>
<p>about the x-axis e.g. are given by
</p>
<p>Rx(θ) = e
iθ J1 = eiθ

<p>1
2 σ1 = 1+

+ . . . (3.185)
</p>
<p>And if we use the explicit matrix form of σ1 (Eq. 3.80), together with
</p>
<p>the fact that σ21 = 1, we get
145 145 The steps are completely analogous
</p>
<p>to what we did in Section 3.4.1

<p>74 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Analogously, we can compute the transformation matrix for rota-
</p>
<p>tions around other axes or boosts. One important thing to notice is
</p>
<p>that we have here complex 2&times; 2 matrices, representing the Lorentz
transformations. These transformations certainly do not act on the
</p>
<p>four-vectors of Minkowski space, because these have 4 components.
</p>
<p>The two-component146 objects this representation acts on are called146 We will learn later that these two
components correspond to spin-up and
spin-down states.
</p>
<p>left-chiral spinors147:
</p>
<p>147 This name will make more sense
after the definition of right-chiral
spinors. Then we can see that parity
transformations transform a left-chiral
spinor transformation into a right-
chiral spinor transformation and vice
versa. These spinors are often called
left-handed and right-handed, but this
can be confusing, because these terms
correspond originally to a concept
called helicity, which is not the same
as chirality. Recall what the parity
operator does: changing a left-handed
coordinate system into a right-handed
coordinate system and vice versa.
Hence the name.

(3.187)
</p>
<p>Spinors in this context are two component objects. A possible
</p>
<p>definition for left-chiral spinors is that they are objects that transform
</p>
<p>under Lorentz transformations according to the ( 12 , 0) representation
</p>
<p>of the Lorentz group. Take note that this is not just another way to
</p>
<p>describe the same thing, because spinors have properties that usual
</p>
<p>vectors do not have. For instance, the factor 12 in the exponent. This
</p>
<p>factor shows us that a spinor is after a rotation by 2π not the same,
</p>
<p>but gets a minus sign148. This is a pretty crazy property, because we

<p>148 There is much more one can say
about spinors. See, for example, chapter
3.2 in J. J. Sakurai. Modern Quantum
Mechanics. Addison Wesley, 1st edition,

</p>
<p>usually expect that objects are exactly the same after a rotation by
</p>
<p>360◦ = 2π.
</p>
<p>In the last section, we saw that the lowest-dimensional representa-
</p>
<p>tion is trivial. The next representation in the "hierarchy" of represen-
</p>
<p>tations is the spinor representation that we discovered in this section.
</p>
<p>In this sense, we can say that

<p>3.7.6 The (0, 12) Representation
</p>
<p>This representation can be constructed analogous to the ( 12 , 0) repre-
</p>
<p>sentation but this time we use the 1 dimensional representation for
</p>
<p>N+i , i.e. N
+
i = 0 and the two dimensional representation for N
</p>
<p>&minus;
i , i.e.
</p>
<p>N&minus;i =
1
2σi . A first guess could be that this representation looks ex-
</p>
<p>actly like the ( 12 , 0) representation, but this is not the case! This time
</p>
<p>we get from the definition of N+ in Eq. 3.169
</p>
<p>N+i =
1
</p>
<p>2
(Ji + iKi) = 0 (3.188)
</p>
<p>&rarr; Ji = &minus;iKi. (3.189)
</p>
<p>Take notice of the minus sign. Using the two-dimensional represen-
</p>
<p>tation of su(2) for N+, which was derived in Section 3.6.3, yields</p>

<p>Eq. 3.189
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
(&minus;iKi &minus; iKi) = &minus;iKi . (3.190)
</p>
<p>Using this we can deduce the (0, 12 ) representation of the boost gener-
</p>
<p>ators
</p>
<p>&minus;iKi =

</p>
<p>2
σi &rarr; Ki =

<p>σi =
&minus;i
2i2
</p>
<p>σi =

</p>
<p>2
σi. (3.191)
</p>
<p>In addition, from Eq. 3.189 we get
</p>
<p>Ji = &minus;iKi =
1
</p>
<p>2
σi . (3.192)
</p>
<p>We conclude that in this representation a Lorentz rotation is given by
</p>
<p>Rθ = e
i�θ&middot;�J = ei�θ&middot;
</p>
<p>�σ
2 (3.193)
</p>

<p>Bφ = e
i�φ&middot;�K = e&minus;�φ&middot;

<p>�σ
2 . (3.194)
</p>
<p>Therefore, rotations are the same as in the ( 12 , 0) representation, but
</p>
<p>boosts differ by a minus sign in the exponent. We conclude both
</p>
<p>representations act on objects that are similar but not the same. We
</p>
<p>call the objects the (0, 12 ) representation of the Lorentz group acts on
</p>
<p>right-chiral spinors:
</p>
<p>χR =

<p>(
(χR)
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>(χR)
2
</p>
<p>)
(3.195)
</p>
<p>The generic name for left- and right-chiral spinors is Weyl spinors.
</p>
<p>3.7.7 Van der Waerden Notation
</p>
<p>Now we introduce a notation that makes working with spinors very
</p>
<p>convenient. We know that we have two kinds of objects that trans-
</p>
<p>form differently and therefore must be distinguished. In the last
</p>
<p>section we learned that they are different, but not too different. In
</p>
<p>a moment we will learn that there is a connection between the ob-
</p>
<p>jects transforming according to the ( 12 , 0) representation (left-chiral
</p>
<p>spinors) and the objects transforming according to the (0, 12 ) repre-
</p>
<p>sentation (right-chiral spinors). To be able to describe these different
</p>
<p>objects using one notation we introduce the notions of dotted and
</p>
<p>undotted indices, sometimes called Van der Waerden notation, after
</p>
<p>their inventor. This will help us to keep track of which object trans-
</p>
<p>forms in what way. This will become much clearer in a minute, as
</p>
<p>soon as we have set up the full formalism.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>76 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s define that a left-chiral spinor χL has a lower, undotted index
</p>
<p>χL = χa (3.196)
</p>
<p>and a right-chiral spinor χR has an upper, dotted index
</p>
<p>χR = χ
ȧ. (3.197)
</p>
<p>Next, we introduce the "spinor metric". The spinor metric enables
</p>
<p>us to transform a right-chiral spinor into a left-chiral and vice versa,
</p>
<p>but not alone as we will see. We define the spinor metric150 as

symbol in two dimensions as defined in
Appendix B.5.5.

</p>
<p>)
(3.198)
</p>
<p>and show that it has the desired properties. Furthermore, we de-
</p>
<p>fine151151 Maybe a short comment on the
strange notation χCL is in order. The su-
perscript C denotes charge conjugation,
as will be explained in Section 3.7.10 in
more detail. Here we see that this op-
eration flips one label, i.e. a left-chiral
spinor becomes right-chiral. Later we
will see this operation flips all labels,
including, for example, the electric
charge.
</p>
<p>χCL &equiv; ǫχ⋆L (3.199)
</p>
<p>where the ⋆ denotes complex conjugation. We will now inspect how
</p>
<p>χCL transforms under Lorentz transformations and see that it trans-
</p>
<p>forms precisely as a right-chiral spinor. The defining feature of a
</p>
<p>right-chiral spinor is its transformation behavior and therefore we
</p>
<p>will conclude that χCL is a right-chiral spinor. Let us have a look at
</p>
<p>how χCL transforms under boosts, where we use
</p>
<p>(&minus;ǫ)(ǫ) = 1 (3.200)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>(ǫ)σ⋆i (&minus;ǫ) = &minus;σi (3.201)
</p>
<p>for each Pauli matrix σi, as you can check by using Eq. 3.198. Trans-
</p>
<p>forming χCL yields

<p>which is exactly the transformation behavior of a right-chiral spinor153. 153 The transformation behavior of

<p>To get to the fifth line, we use the series expansion of e
�φ

<p>on every term. You can check in the same way that the behavior un-
</p>
<p>der rotations is not changed by complex conjugation and multiplica-

<p>tion with ǫ, as it should be, because χL and χR transform in the same

</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can check that ǫ is invariant under all transforma-
</p>
<p>tions and that if we want to go the other way round, i.e. transform a
</p>
<p>right-chiral spinor into a left-chiral spinor, we have to use (-ǫ).
</p>
<p>Therefore, we define in analogy with the tensor notation of special
</p>
<p>relativity that our "metric" raises and lowers indices
</p>
<p>ǫχL =︸︷︷︸
written in index notation
</p>
<p>ǫacχc = χ
a , (3.204)
</p>
<p>where summation over identical indices is implicitly assumed (Ein-

<p>stein summation convention). Furthermore, we know that if we want
</p>
<p>to get χR from χL we need to use complex conjugation as well
</p>
<p>χR = ǫχL
⋆ . (3.205)
</p>
<p>This means that complex conjugation transforms an undotted index
</p>
<p>into a dotted index:
</p>
<p>χR = ǫχL
⋆ = χȧ. (3.206)
</p>
<p>Therefore, we can get a lower, dotted index by complex conjugating
</p>
<p>χL:
</p>
<p>χL
⋆ = χa
</p>
<p>⋆ = χȧ (3.207)

<p>and an upper, undotted index, by complex conjugating χR

<p>χR
⋆ = (χȧ)⋆ = χa . (3.208)
</p>
<p>It is instructive to investigate how χȧ and χ
a transform, because

<p>these objects are needed to construct terms from spinors, which do

<p>not change under Lorentz transformations. Terms like this are incred-

</p>
<p>To be able to write products of spinors that do not change under
</p>
<p>Lorentz transformations, we need one more ingredient. Recall how
</p>
<p>the scalar product of two vectors is defined: �a &middot;�b = �aT�b. In the same
spirit we should transpose one of the spinors in a spinor product.
</p>
<p>We can see this, because at the moment we have the complex con-
</p>
<p>jugate of the Pauli matrices σ⋆i in the exponent, for example, e
&minus;i�θ �σ⋆2 .
</p>
<p>Together with transposing this becomes the Hermitian conjugate:
</p>
<p>σ&dagger;i = (σ
⋆
i )
</p>
<p>T , where the symbol &dagger; is called "dagger". The Hermitian
</p>
<p>conjugate of every Pauli matrix, is again the same Pauli matrix
</p>
<p>σ&dagger;i = (σ
⋆
i )
</p>
<p>T = σi, (3.213)
</p>
<p>as you can easily check by looking at the explicit form of the Pauli
</p>
<p>matrices (Eq. 3.80).
</p>
<p>By comparing Eq. 3.209 with Eq. 3.212 and using Eq. 3.213, we
</p>
<p>see that the transformation behavior of a transposed spinor with
</p>
<p>lower, undotted index is exactly the opposite of a spinor with upper,
</p>
<p>undotted index. This means a term of the form (χa)Tχa is invariant
</p>
<p>(=does not change) under Lorentz transformations, because154154 As explained in Appendix B.5.5, the
symbol δcb is called Kronecker symbol
and denotes the unit matrix in index
notation. This means δcb = 1 for b = c
and δcb = 0 for b �= c.</p>

<p>In the same way we can combine an upper, dotted index with a

<p>lower, dotted index as you can verify by comparing Eq. 3.210 with
</p>
<p>Eq. 3.211. In contrast, a term of the form (χȧ)Tχa=̂χTRχL isn&rsquo;t invari-

<p>(3.215)
</p>
<p>Therefore a term combining a left-chiral with a right-chiral spinor
</p>
<p>is not Lorentz invariant. We conclude, we must always combine an
</p>
<p>upper with a lower index of the same type155 in order to get Lorentz 155 In this context dotted ȧ ȧ

Tχȧ to get

<p>Lorentz invariant terms. We will use this later, when need invariant
</p>
<p>terms that we can use to formulate our laws of nature.
</p>
<p>In addition, we have now another justification for calling ǫab the
</p>
<p>spinor metric, because the invariant spinor product in Eq. 3.214, can
</p>
<p>be written as
</p>
<p>χTa χ

Eq. 3.204
</p>
<p>χTa ǫ

</p>
<p>Compare this to how we defined in Eq. 2.31 the invariant product of
</p>
<p>Minkowsi space by using the Minkowski metric ημν:
</p>
<p>xμy
μ = xμη
</p>
<p>μνyν. (3.217)
</p>
<p>The spinor metric is for spinors indeed what the Minkowski metric is
</p>
<p>for four-vectors156.
</p>
<p>156 Don&rsquo;t get confused why we have
no transposition for the four-vectors
here. These equations can be read in
two ways. On the one hand as vector
equations and on the other hand as
component equations. It&rsquo;s conventional
and sometimes confusing to use the
same symbol xμ for a four-vector
and its components. If we read the
equation as a component equation we
need no transposition. The same is of
course true for our spinor products.
Nevertheless, we have seen above that
we mustn&rsquo;t forget to transpose and in
order to avoid errors we included the
explicit superscript T, although the
spinor equation here can be read as
component equation that do not need it.
In contrast, for three component vectors
there is a clear distinction using the
little arrow: �a has components ai .
</p>
<p>After setting up this notation, we can now write the spinor "met-</p>

<p>because we need157 (&minus;ǫ) to get from χR to χL. In addition, we can157 You can check this yourself, but it&rsquo;s
not very important for what follows. now write the two transformation operators as one object Λ. For
</p>
<p>example, when it has dotted indices we know it multiplies with a
</p>
<p>right-chiral spinor and we know which transformation operator to

<p>choose:
</p>

(3.222)
</p>
<p>This notation is useful, because, as we have seen, the two different
</p>
<p>objects χL and χR aren&rsquo;t so different after all. In fact we can trans-
</p>
<p>form them into each other and a unified notation is the logical result.
</p>
<p>Now we move on to the next irreducible representation, which will
</p>
<p>turn out to be an old acquaintance.
</p>
<p>3.7.8 The (12 ,
1
2) Representation
</p>
<p>For this representation we use the 2-dimensional representation for
</p>
<p>both copies of the SU(2) Lie algebra158 N+i and N
&minus;
i . This time let&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>158 Mathematically we have
( 12 ,
</p>
<p>1
2 ) = (
</p>
<p>1
2 , 0)&otimes; (0, 12 ). have a look at what kind of object our representation is going to act
</p>
<p>on first. The copies will not interfere with each other, because N+i
and N&minus;i commute, i.e. [N
</p>
<p>+
i , N
</p>
<p>&minus;
j ] = 0 (Eq. 3.172). Therefore, our
</p>
<p>objects will transform separately under both copies. Let&rsquo;s name the
</p>
<p>object we want to examine v. This object will have 2 indices vḃa, each
</p>
<p>transforming under a separate two-dimensional copy of su(2). Here
</p>
<p>the notation we introduced in the last section comes in handy.
</p>
<p>We know that our object v will have 4 components, because each
</p>
<p>representation is 2 dimensional and this means that both indices can
</p>
<p>take on two values ( 12 and &minus; 12 ). Therefore, the objects can be 2&times; 2
matrices, but it&rsquo;s also possible to enforce a four component vector
</p>
<p>form, as we will see159.
</p>
<p>159 Remember that when we talked
about rotations of the plane we were in
the same situation. The rotation could
be described by complex numbers
acting on complex numbers. Doing
the map to real matrices we had real
matrices acting on real matrices, but
the same action could be described by a
real matrix acting on a column vector.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lie group theory 81
</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the complex matrix choice. A general 2 &times; 2
matrix has 4 complex entries and therefore 8 free parameters. As
</p>
<p>noted above, we only need 4. We can write every complex matrix M
</p>
<p>as a sum of a Hermitian (H&dagger; = H) and an anti-Hermitian (A&dagger; = &minus;A)
matrix: M = H + A. Both Hermitian and anti-Hermitian matrices
</p>
<p>have 4 free parameters. In addition, we will see in a moment that our
</p>
<p>transformations in this representation always transform a Hermitian
</p>
<p>2&times; 2 matrix into another Hermitian 2&times; 2 matrix and equivalently
an anti-Hermitian matrix into another anti-Hermitian matrix. This
</p>
<p>means Hermitian and anti-Hermitian matrices are invariant subsets.
</p>
<p>As explained in Section 3.5 this means that working with a general
</p>
<p>matrix here, corresponds to having a reducible representation. Putting
</p>
<p>these observations together, we conclude that we can assume that
</p>
<p>our irreducible representation acts on Hermitian 2&times; 2 matrices. A
basis160 for Hermitian 2&times; 2 matrices is given by the Pauli matrices 160 This means that an arbitrary Her-
</p>
<p>mitian 2 &times; 2 matrix can be written
as a linear combination of the form:
a01+ aiσi
</p>
<p>together with the identity matrix.
</p>
<p>Instead of examining vḃa, we will have a look at vaḃ, because then
</p>
<p>we can use the Pauli matrices as defined in Eq. 3.80. Take note that vḃa
and vaḃ can be transformed into each other by multiplication with ǫ
</p>
<p>ḃċ
</p>
<p>and therefore if you want to work with vḃa, you simply have to use the
</p>
<p>Pauli matrices that have been multiplied with ǫ.
</p>
<p>If we define σ0 = I2&times;2 =
</p>
<p>(
1 0
</p>
<p>0 1
</p>
<p>)
, we can write
</p>
<p>vaḃ = vνσ
ν
aḃ
</p>
<p>= v0
(
1 0
</p>
<p>0 1
</p>
<p>)

</p>
<p>(
0 1
</p>
<p>1 0
</p>
<p>)
+ v2
</p>
<p>(
0 &minus;i
i 0
</p>
<p>)
+ v3
</p>
<p>(
1 0
</p>
<p>0 &minus;1
</p>
<p>)
.
</p>
<p>(3.223)
</p>
<p>As explained above, we could use161 vḃa = vμσ
μ
aċǫ
</p>
<p>ḃċ instead, which 161 This is really just a basis choice and
here we choose the basis that gives
us with our definition of the Pauli
matrices, the transformation behavior
we derived earlier for vectors.
</p>
<p>means we would use the basis (σ̃ḃa )
μ = σ
</p>
<p>μ
aċǫ
</p>
<p>ḃċ. We therefore write a
</p>
<p>general Hermitian matrix as

</p>
<p>(
v0 + v3 v1 &minus; iv2
v1 + iv2 v0 &minus; v3
</p>
<p>)
. (3.224)
</p>
<p>Remember that we have learned in the last section that different
</p>
<p>indices transform differently. For example, a lower dotted index
</p>
<p>transforms differently than a lower undotted index.
</p>
<p>Now we have a look at how vaḃ transforms and use the transforma-</p>

<p>This is true for arbitrary Lorentz transformations, as you can check
</p>
<p>by computing the other possibilities. What we have shown here is
</p>
<p>that the ( 12 ,
1
2 ) representation is the vector representation. We can
</p>
<p>simplify our transformation laws by using the enforced vector form,
</p>
<p>because multiplying a matrix with a vector is simpler than the multi-
</p>
<p>plication of three matrices. Nevertheless, we have seen how the famil-
</p>
<p>iar 4-vector is related to the more fundamental spinors. A 4-vector is
</p>
<p>a rank-2 spinor, which means a spinor with 2 indices that transforms
</p>
<p>according to the ( 12 ,
1
2 ) representation of the Lorentz group. Further-
</p>
<p>more, we can now see that 4-vectors aren&rsquo;t appropriate to describe
</p>
<p>every physical system on a fundamental level, because they aren&rsquo;t
</p>
<p>fundamental. There are physical systems they cannot describe.
</p>
<p>We can now understand why some people say that "spinors are
</p>
<p>the square root of vectors". This is meant in the same way as vectors
</p>
<p>are the square root of rank-2 tensors168. A rank-2 tensor has two 168 A rank-2 tensor is simply a matrix
Mμν.vector indices and a vector has two spinor indices. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>most basic object that can be Lorentz transformed is indeed a spinor.
</p>
<p>When we started our studies of the Lorentz group, we noted that it
</p>
<p>consists of four components169. These components are connected by 169 Eq. 3.142: O(1, 3) =
{L&uarr;+,ΛP L&uarr;+,ΛT L&uarr;+,ΛPΛT L&uarr;+}.the parity and the time-reversal operator170. Therefore, to be able to
</p>
<p>170 See Eq. 3.142
describe all transformations that preserve the speed of light, we need
</p>
<p>to find the parity and time-reversal transformation for each repre-
</p>
<p>sentation. In this text we restrict ourselves to parity transformations,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>84 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>because the discussion for the time-reversal transformation is very
</p>
<p>similar. We will discuss in in a later section that nature isn&rsquo;t always
</p>
<p>symmetric under parity transformations171.171 Nature isn&rsquo;t invariant under time-
reversal transformations either, but a
satisfying discussion of this curious fact
lies beyond the scope of this book. 3.7.9 Spinors and Parity
</p>
<p>Up to this point, there is no justification why we call the objects
</p>
<p>transforming according to the ( 12 , 0) representation left-chiral and
</p>
<p>the objects transforming according to the (0, 12 ) representation right-
</p>
<p>chiral. After talking a bit about parity transformation, this will make
</p>
<p>sense.
</p>
<p>Recall that we already know the behavior of the generators of
</p>
<p>the Lorentz group under parity transformations. The result was
</p>
<p>Eq. 3.161, which we recite here for convenience

we also recite here
</p>
<p>N&plusmn;i =
1
</p>
<p>2
(Ji &plusmn; iKi) . (3.231)
</p>
<p>we can see that under parity transformations N+ &harr; N&minus;. There-
fore, the (0, 12 ) representation of a transformation, becomes the (
</p>
<p>1
2 , 0)
</p>
<p>representation of this transformation and vice versa under parity
</p>
<p>transformations. This is the reason for talking about left- and right-
</p>
<p>chiral spinors172. Just as a right-handed coordinate system changes172 The conventional name is left- and
right-handed spinors, but this can
be quite confusing, because the no-
tions left-handed and right-handed
are directly related to a concept called
helicity, which is different from chi-
rality. Anyway the name should make
some sense, because something left is
changed into something right under
parity transformations.
</p>
<p>into a left-handed coordinate system under parity transformations,
</p>
<p>these two representations change into each other.
</p>
<p>Rotations are the same for both representations, but boost trans-
</p>
<p>formations differ by a sign and it is easy to make the above statement
</p>
<p>explicit:
</p>
<p>(Λ�K)( 12 ,0)

</p>
<p>. (3.233)
</p>
<p>We learn here that if we want to describe a physical system that
</p>
<p>is invariant under parity transformations, we will always need right-
</p>
<p>chiral and left-chiral spinors. The easiest thing to do is to write them
</p>
<p>below each other into a single object called Dirac spinor

<p>Recalling that the generic name for left- and right-chiral spinors is

<p>transformations in block-diagonal form into one big matrix:

<p>0 Λ(0, 12 )

. (3.237)
</p>
<p>It is instructive to investigate how Dirac spinors behave under
</p>
<p>parity transformations, because once we know how Dirac spinors
</p>
<p>transform under parity transformations, we can check if a given
</p>
<p>theory is invariant under such transformations. We can&rsquo;t expect that
</p>
<p>a Dirac spinor is after a parity transformation still a Dirac spinor (an
</p>
<p>object transforming according to the ( 12 , 0) &oplus; (0, 12 ) representation),
because we know that under parity transformations N+ &harr; N&minus; and

. (3.238)
</p>
<p>We conclude that if a Dirac spinor transforms according to the
</p>
<p>( 12 , 0)&oplus; (0, 12 ) representation, the parity transformed object trans-
forms according to the (0, 12 )&oplus; ( 12 , 0) representation.

<p>A parity transformed Dirac spinor contains the same objects ξR, χL
as the untransformed Dirac spinor, only written differently. A parity
</p>
<p>transformation does nothing like ξL &rarr; ξR, which is a different kind
of transformation we will talk about in the next section.
</p>
<p>3.7.10 Spinors and Charge Conjugation
</p>
<p>In Section 3.7.7 we stumbled upon a transformation, which yields
</p>
<p>χL &rarr; χR and ξR &rarr; ξL. The transformation is achieved by χL &rarr; χCL =
ǫχ⋆L = χR and analogously for a right-chiral spinor ξR &rarr; ξCR =
(&minus;ǫ)ξ⋆R = ξL. We are now able to understand it from a quite different
perspective.
</p>
<p>Up to this point, we used this transformation merely as a compu-
</p>
<p>tational trick in order to raise and lower indices. Now, how does a
</p>
<p>Dirac spinor transform under such a transformation? Naively we get:
</p>
<p>Ψ =
</p>
<p>(
χL
ξR
</p>
<p>)
&rarr; Ψ̃ =
</p>
<p>(
χCL
ξCR
</p>
<p>)
=
</p>
<p>(
χR
ξL
</p>
<p>)
. (3.241)
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this object does not transform like a Dirac spinor175,175 Unlike for parity transformations,
we have a choice here and we prefer
to keep working with the same kind of
object. The object Ψ̃ can then be seen
as a Dirac spinor that has been parity
transformed and charge conjugated.
</p>
<p>which transform under boosts as follows
</p>
<p>Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime; =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎝e
</p>
<p>�θ

</p>
<p>0 e

2 �σ
</p>
<p>⎞
⎠
</p>
<p>(
χL
ξR
</p>
<p>)
. (3.242)
</p>
<p>In contrast, the object Ψ̃ we get from the naive operation, transforms
</p>
<p>as
</p>
<p>Ψ̃ &rarr; Ψ̃&prime; =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎝e
</p>
<p>&minus;�θ2�σ 0
</p>
<p>0 e
�θ
2�σ
</p>
<p>⎞
⎠
</p>
<p>(
χL
ξR
</p>
<p>)
. (3.243)
</p>
<p>This is a different kind of object, because it transforms according to a
</p>
<p>different representation of the Lorentz group. Therefore we write
</p>
<p>Ψ =
</p>
<p>(
χL
ξR
</p>
<p>)
&rarr; ΨC =
</p>
<p>(
ξCR
χCL
</p>
<p>)
=
</p>
<p>(
ξL
χR
</p>
<p>)
, (3.244)
</p>
<p>which incorporates the transformation behavior we observed ear-
</p>
<p>lier and transforms like a Dirac spinor. This operation is commonly
</p>
<p>called charge conjugation, which can be a little misleading. We know
</p>
<p>that this transformation transforms a left-chiral spinor into a right-
</p>
<p>chiral, i.e. flips one label we use to describe our elementary parti-
</p>
<p>cles176. Later we will learn that this operator flips not only one, but176 For the more advanced reader: Recall
that each Weyl spinor we are talking
about here, is in fact a two component
object. Later we will define a physical
measurable quantity, called spin, that
is described by 12σ3. The matrix ǫ, flips
</p>
<p>an object with eigenvalue + 12 for the
</p>
<p>spin operator 12σ3 into an object with
</p>
<p>eigenvalue &minus; 12 . This is commonly
interpreted as spin flip, which means an
object with spin 12 , becomes an object
</p>
<p>with spin &minus; 12 .
</p>
<p>all labels we use to describe fundamental particles. One such label is
</p>
<p>electric charge, hence the name charge conjugation, but before we are
</p>
<p>able to show this, we need of course to understand first what electric</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lie group theory 87
</p>
<p>charge is. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s always important to remember that all
</p>
<p>labels get flipped, not only electric charge.
</p>
<p>We could now go on and derive higher-dimensional representa-
</p>
<p>tions of the Lorentz group, but at this point we already have every
</p>
<p>finite-dimensional irreducible representation we need for the purpose
</p>
<p>of this text. Nevertheless, there is another representation, the infinite-
</p>
<p>dimensional representation, that is especially interesting, because
</p>
<p>we need it to transform fields, like, for example, the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>field.
</p>
<p>3.7.11 Infinite-Dimensional Representations
</p>
<p>In the last sections, we talked about finite-dimensional representa-
</p>
<p>tions of the Lorentz group and learned how we can classify them.
</p>
<p>These finite-dimensional representations acted on constant one-,
</p>
<p>two- or four-component objects. In physics the objects we are deal-
</p>
<p>ing with are dynamically changing in space and time, so we need to
</p>
<p>understand how such objects transform. So far, we have dealt with
</p>
<p>transformations of the form
</p>
<p>Φa &rarr; Φ&prime;a = Mab(Λ)Φb , (3.245)
</p>
<p>where Mab(Λ) denotes the matrix of the particular finite-dimensional
</p>
<p>representation of the Lorentz transformation Λ. This means Mab(Λ)
</p>
<p>is a matrix that acts, for example, on a two-component object like a
</p>
<p>Weyl spinor. The result of the multiplication with this matrix is sim-
</p>
<p>ply that the components of the object in question get mixed and are
</p>
<p>multiplied with constant factors. If our object Φ changes in space and
</p>
<p>time, it is a function of coordinates177 Φ = Φ(x) and these coordi- 177 Here x is a shorthand notation for all
spacetime coordinates t, x, y, znates are affected by the Lorentz transformations, too. In general we
</p>
<p>have
</p>
<p>xμ &rarr; Λμν xν, (3.246)
where Λ
</p>
<p>μ
ν denotes the vector representation (= (
</p>
<p>1
2 ,
</p>
<p>1
2 ) representation)
</p>
<p>of the Lorentz transformation in question. We have in this case178 178 Most books use the Wigner con-
vention for symmetry operators:
Φa(x) &rarr; Mab(Λ)Φb(Λ&minus;1x), but
unfortunately there is at this point no
way to motivate this convention.
</p>
<p>Φa(x) &rarr; Mab(Λ)Φb(Λx). (3.247)
</p>
<p>Our transformation will therefore consist of two parts. One part, rep-
</p>
<p>resented by a finite-dimensional representation, acting on Φa and a
</p>
<p>second part that transforms the spacetime coordinates x. This sec-
</p>
<p>ond part will act on an infinite-dimensional179 vector space and we
</p>
<p>179 Each component of Φ is now a
function of x. The corresponding
operators act on Φa(x), i.e. functions
of the coordinates and the space of
functions is in this context infinite-
dimensional. The reason that the space
of functions is infinite-dimensional
is that we need an infinite number of
basis functions. The expansion of an
arbitrary function in terms of such an
infinite number of basis functions is the
idea behind the Fourier transform as
explained in Appendix D.1.
</p>
<p>therefore need an infinite-dimensional representation. The infinite-
</p>
<p>dimensional representation of the Lorentz group is given by differen-
</p>
<p>tial operators180
</p>
<p>180 The symbols &part;ν are a shorthand
notation for the partial derivative &part;&part;ν .
</p>
<p>Minfμν = i(x
μ&part;ν &minus; xν&part;μ) . (3.248)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>88 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>You can check by a straightforward computation that Minfμν satisfies
</p>
<p>the Lorentz algebra (Eq. 3.175) and transforms the coordinates as
</p>
<p>desired.
</p>
<p>The transformation of the coordinates is now given by181181 Recall the definition of Mμν in
Eq. 3.173. The components of ωμν can
then be directly related to the usual
rotation angles θi =
</p>
<p>1
2 ǫijkωjk and the
</p>
<p>boost parameters φi = ω0i .

<p>Φ&prime;(Λx) = e&minus;i

<p>2 M
inf
μν Φ(x), (3.249)
</p>
<p>where the exponential function is, as usual, understood in terms
</p>
<p>of its series expansion. The complete transformation is then a com-
</p>
<p>bination of a transformation generated by the finite-dimensional
</p>
<p>representation Mfinμν and a transformation generated by the infinite-
</p>
<p>dimensional representation Minfμν of the generators:
</p>
<p>Φa(x) &rarr;
(
e&minus;i

</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>e&minus;i
ωμν
</p>
<p>2 M
inf
μν Φb(x). (3.250)
</p>
<p>Because our matrices Mfinμν are finite-dimensional and constant we can
</p>
<p>put the two exponents together
</p>
<p>Φa(x) &rarr;
(
e&minus;i
</p>
<p>ωμν
</p>

)b
</p>
<p>a
Φb(x) (3.251)
</p>
<p>with Mμν = Mfinμν + M
inf
μν . This representation of the generators of the
</p>
<p>Lorentz group is called field representation.
</p>
<p>We can now talk about a different kind of transformation: transla-
</p>
<p>tions, which means transformations to another location in spacetime.
</p>
<p>Translations do not mix the components and therefore, we need no
</p>
<p>finite-dimensional representation. However, it&rsquo;s quite easy to find
</p>
<p>the infinite-dimensional representation for translations. These are
</p>
<p>not part of the Lorentz group, but the laws of nature should be lo-
</p>
<p>cation independent. The Lorentz group (boosts and rotations) plus
</p>
<p>translations is called the Poincar&eacute; group, which is the topic of the
</p>
<p>next section. Nevertheless, we will introduce the infinite-dimensional
</p>
<p>representation of translations already here. For simplicity, we restrict
</p>
<p>ourselves to one dimension. In this case an infinitesimal translation
</p>
<p>of a function, along the x-axis is given by182182 For a non-infinitesimal ǫ, we would
get here infinitely many terms. But for
an infinitesimal ǫ, we use ǫ2 &asymp; 0 and
therefore neglect all higher order terms.
</p>
<p>Φ(x) &rarr; Φ(x + ǫ) = Φ(x) + &part;xΦ(x)︸ ︷︷ ︸
"rate of change" along the x-axis
</p>
<p>ǫ,
</p>
<p>which is, of course, the first term of the Taylor series expansion. It is
</p>
<p>conventional in physics to add an extra &minus;i to the generator and we
therefore define
</p>
<p>Pi &equiv; &minus;i&part;i. (3.252)
</p>
<p>With this definition an arbitrary, finite translation is183183 Using i2 = &minus;1.</p>

</p>

<p>spacetime does not change its value. If we add these symmetries to
</p>
<p>the Lorentz group we get the Poincar&eacute; group186 186 The Poincar&eacute; group is not the direct,
but the semi-direct, sum of the Lorentz
group and translations, but for the
purpose of this text we can neglect this
technical detail.Poincar&eacute; group = Lorentz group plus translations
</p>
<p>= Rotations plus boosts plus translations (3.253)
</p>
<p>The generators of the Poincar&eacute; group are the generators of the

</p>
<p>[Mμν, Mρσ] = i(ημρMνσ &minus; ημσMνρ &minus; ηνρMμσ + ηνσMμρ) . (3.265)
</p>
<p>For this quite complicated group it is very useful to label the rep-
</p>
<p>resentations by using the fixed scalar values of the Casimir operators.
</p>
<p>The Poincar&eacute; group has two Casimir operators188 . The first one is:188 Recall that a Casimir operator is
defined as an operator, constructed
from the generators, that commutes
with all other generators. PμP
</p>
<p>μ =: m2. (3.266)
</p>
<p>We give the scalar value the suggestive name m2, because we will
</p>
<p>learn later that it coincides with the mass of particles189.189 Don&rsquo;t worry, this will make much
more sense later.
</p>
<p>The second Casimir operator is WμW
μ, where190
</p>
<p>190 ǫμνρσ is the four-dimensional Levi-
Civita symbol, which is defined in
Appendix B.5.5. Wμ =
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
ǫμνρσPνMρσ (3.267)
</p>
<p>which is called the Pauli-Lubanski four-vector. In a lengthy com-
</p>
<p>putation it can be justified, that in addition to m, we use the number
</p>
<p>j &equiv; j1 + j2 as a label. This label is commonly called spin. For the
moment this is just a name. Later we will understand why the name
</p>
<p>spin is appropriate. Exactly as for the Lorentz group, we have one ji
for each of the two191 representations of the SU(2) algebra.191 Recall that the complexified Lie al-
</p>
<p>gebra of the Lorentz group could be
seen to consist of two copies of the Lie
algebra of SU(2). The representations
of SU(2) could be labelled by a number
j and consequently we used for repre-
sentations of the double cover of the
Lorentz group two numbers (j1, j2).
</p>
<p>For example, the (j1, j2) = (0, 0) representation is called spin 0
</p>
<p>representation192. The (j1, j2) = (
1
2 , 0) and (j1, j2) = (0,
</p>
<p>1
2 ) are both
</p>
<p>192 j1 + j2 = 0+ 0 = 0
</p>
<p>called spin 12 representations
193 and analogously the (j1, j2) = (
</p>
<p>1
2 ,
</p>
<p>1
2 )
</p>
<p>193 j1 + j2 =
1
2 + 0 = 0+
</p>
<p>1
2 =

</p>
<p>representation is called spin 1 representation194.
</p>
<p>194 j1 + j2 =
1
2 +
</p>
<p>1
2 = 1
</p>
<p>The message to take away is that each representation is labelled by
</p>
<p>two scalar values: m and j. While m can take on arbitrary values, j is
</p>
<p>restricted to half-integer or integer values.</p>

<p>3.9 Elementary Particles
</p>
<p>The labels for the irreducible representations of double cover of the
</p>
<p>Poincar&eacute; group, mass m and by their spin (= j here), are how ele-
</p>
<p>mentary particles are labeled in physics195. An elementary particle 195 Some physicists go even farther
and say that elementary particles are
the irreducible representations of the
Poincar&eacute; group.
</p>
<p>with given labels m and spin, say j = 12 , is described by an object,
</p>
<p>which transforms according to the m, spin 12 representation of the
</p>
<p>Poincar&eacute; group.
</p>
<p>More labels, called charges, will follow later from internal sym-
</p>
<p>metries. These labels are used to define an elementary particle. For
</p>
<p>example, an electron is defined by the following labels
</p>
<p>&bull; mass: 9, 109 &middot; 10&minus;31 kg,
</p>
<p>&bull; spin: 12 ,
</p>
<p>&bull; electric charge: 1, 602 &middot; 10&minus;19 C,
</p>
<p>&bull; weak charge, called weak isospin: &minus; 12 ,
</p>
<p>&bull; strong charge, called color charge: 0.
</p>
<p>These labels determine how a given elementary particle behaves
</p>
<p>in experiments. The representations we derived in this chapter define
</p>
<p>how we can describe them mathematically. An elementary particle
</p>
<p>with196 196 Remember that in the introductory
remarks about what we can&rsquo;t derive,
it was said there is no real reason to
stop here after three representations.
We could go on to higher dimensional
representations, but there are no ele-
mentary particles, for example, with
spin 32 . Nevertheless, such representa-
tions can be used to describe composite
objects. In addition, there are many
physicists that believe the fundamen-
tal particle mediating gravity, called
graviton, has spin 2 and therefore a
corresponding higher dimensional
representation must be used to describe
it.
</p>
<p>&bull; spin 0 is described by an object Φ, called scalar, that transforms
</p>
<p>according to the (0, 0), called spin 0 representation or scalar repre-
</p>
<p>sentation. For example, the Higgs particle is described by a scalar
</p>
<p>field.
</p>
<p>&bull; spin 12 is described by an object Ψ, called spinor, that transforms
</p>
<p>according to the ( 12 , 0) &oplus; (0, 12 ) representation, called spin 12 rep-
resentation or spinor representation. For example, electrons and
</p>
<p>quarks are described by spinors.
</p>
<p>&bull; spin 1 is described by an object A, called vector, that transforms
</p>
<p>according to the ( 12 ,
1
2 ), called spin 1 representation or vector
</p>
<p>representation. For example photons are described by vectors.
</p>
<p>This is an incredibly important, deep and beautiful insight, so
</p>
<p>again:
</p>
<p>What we get from deriving the irreducible representations of the
</p>
<p>Poincar&eacute; group are the mathematical tools we need to describe all
</p>
<p>elementary particles. To describe spin 0 particles, like the Higgs
</p>
<p>Boson, we use mathematical objects, called scalars, that transform</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>92 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>according to the spin 0 representation. To describe spin 12 particles
</p>
<p>like electrons, neutrinos, quarks etc. we use mathematical objects,
</p>
<p>called spinors, that transform according to the spin 12 representation.
</p>
<p>To describe photons or other particles with spin 1 we use objects,
</p>
<p>called vectors, transforming according to the spin 1 representation.
</p>
<p>An explanation for the very suggestive name spin, will be given
</p>
<p>in Section 8.5.5, after we talked about how and what we measure in
</p>
<p>experiments. We first have to know how we are able to find out if
</p>
<p>something is spinning, before we can justify the name spin. At this
</p>
<p>point, spin is merely a label.

<p>3.10 Appendix: Rotations in a Complex Vector
</p>
<p>Space
</p>
<p>The concept of transformations that preserve the inner product can
</p>
<p>also be used in complex vector spaces. We want the inner product
</p>
<p>of a vector with itself to be a real number, because by definition this
</p>
<p>should result in the squared length of the vector. A complex number
</p>
<p>would make little sense as the length of the vector. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>inner product of complex vector spaces is defined with additional
</p>
<p>complex conjugation200200 Because for z = a + ib we have
z⋆ = a &minus; ib and therefore
</p>
<p>z⋆z = (a + ib)(a &minus; ib) = a2 + b2, which
is real.
</p>
<p>a &middot; a = (aT)⋆a = a&dagger;a. (3.268)
</p>
<p>The symbol &dagger;, called dagger, denotes Hermitian conjugation, which
</p>
<p>means complex conjugation and transposing. We see that a trans-
</p>
<p>formation that preserves this inner product must fulfil the condition
</p>
<p>U&dagger;U = 1:
</p>
<p>(Ua) &middot; (Ua) = a&dagger;U&dagger;Ua = a&dagger;a . (3.269)
Transformations like these form groups that are called U(n), where n
</p>
<p>denotes the dimensions of the complex vector space and "U" stands</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lie group theory 93
</p>
<p>for unitary. Again the groups SU(n) are called "special", because
</p>
<p>their elements fulfil the additional condition det(U) = 1.
</p>
<p>3.11 Appendix: Manifolds
</p>
<p>A manifold M is a set of points with a continuous 1-1 map from each
</p>
<p>open neighborhood onto an open set of Rn. In easy words this means
</p>
<p>that a manifold M looks locally like the standard Rn. This map from
</p>
<p>each open neighborhood of M onto Rn associates with each point P
</p>
<p>of M an n-tupel (x1(P), ...xn(P)) where the numbers x1(P), ...xn(P)
</p>
<p>are called the coordinates of the point P. Therefore another way of
</p>
<p>thinking about a n-dimensional manifold is that it&rsquo;s a set, which can
</p>
<p>be given n independent coordinates ins some neighborhood of any
</p>
<p>point.
</p>
<p>An example for a manifold is the surface of a ball. The surface
</p>
<p>of the three-dimensional ball is called two-sphere S2 and is defined
</p>
<p>as the set of points in R3 for which x2 + y2 + z2 = r holds, where
</p>
<p>r is the radius of the sphere. Take note that the surface of the three-
</p>
<p>dimensional ball is two-dimensional, because the definition involves
</p>
<p>3 coordinates and one condition, which eliminates one degree of
</p>
<p>freedom. That is why it&rsquo;s called mathematically two-sphere. To see
</p>
<p>that the sphere is a manifold we need a map onto R2. This map is
</p>
<p>given by the usual spherical coordinates.
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.9: Illustration of the map from
one neighborhood of the sphere on to
Rn.
</p>
<p>Almost all points on the surface of the sphere can be identified
</p>
<p>unambiguously with a coordinate combination of the form (ϕ, θ). Al-
</p>
<p>most all! Where is the pole ϕ = 0 mapped to? There is no one-to-one
</p>
<p>identification possible, because the pole is mapped to a whole line,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>94 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>as indicated in the image. Therefore this map does not work for the
</p>
<p>complete sphere and we need another map in the neighborhood of
</p>
<p>the pole to describe things there. A similar problem occurs for the
</p>
<p>map on the semicircle θ = 0. Each point can be mapped in the R2
</p>
<p>to θ = 0 and θ = 2π, which is again not a one-to-one map. This
</p>
<p>illustrates the fact that for manifolds there is in general not one coor-
</p>
<p>dinate system for all points of the manifold, only local coordinates,
</p>
<p>which are valid in some neighborhood. This is no problem because
</p>
<p>the defining feature of a manifold is that it looks locally like Rn.
</p>
<p>The spherical coordinate map is only valid in the open neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood 0 &lt; ϕ &lt; π, 0 &lt; θ &lt; 2π and we need a second map to cover
</p>
<p>the whole sphere. We can use, for example, a second spherical coor-
</p>
<p>dinate system with different orientation, such that the problematic
</p>
<p>poles lie at different points for this map and no longer at ϕ = 0. With
</p>
<p>this second map every point of the sphere has a map onto R2 and the
</p>
<p>two-sphere can be seen to be a manifold.
</p>
<p>A trivial example for a manifold is of course Rn.</p>

<p>The Framework
</p>
<p>The basic idea of this chapter is that we get the correct equations
</p>
<p>of nature, by minimizing something. What could this something be?
</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: the object shouldn&rsquo;t change under Lorentz
</p>
<p>transformations, because otherwise we get different laws of nature
</p>
<p>for different frames of reference. In mathematical terms this means
</p>
<p>the object we are searching for must be a scalar, which is an object
</p>
<p>transforming according to the (0, 0) representation of the Lorentz
</p>
<p>group. Together with the restriction to the simplest possible choice
</p>
<p>this will be enough to derive the correct equations of nature. Nature
</p>
<p>likes it simple.
</p>
<p>Starting with this idea, we will introduce a framework called the
</p>
<p>Lagrangian formalism. By minimizing the central object of the the-
</p>
<p>ory we get the equations of motion that describe the physical system
</p>
<p>in question. The result of this minimization procedure is called the
</p>
<p>Euler-Lagrange equations.
</p>
<p>The Lagrangian formalism enables us to derive one of the most-
</p>
<p>important theorems of modern physics: Noether&rsquo;s Theorem. This
</p>
<p>theorem reveals the deep connection between symmetries and con-
</p>
<p>served quantities1. We will use this connection in the next chapter to

that does not change in time. Famous
examples are the energy or the momen-
tum of a given system. In mathematical
terms this means &part;tQ = 0 &rarr; Q =const.
</p>
<p>understand how the quantities that we measure in experiments can
</p>
<p>be described by the theory.
</p>
<p>4.1 Lagrangian Formalism
</p>
<p>The Lagrangian formalism is an incredibly powerful framework2 that
</p>
<p>2 There are of course other frameworks,
e.g. the Hamiltonian formalism, which
has the Hamiltonian as its central
object. The problem with the Hamilto-
nian is that it is not Lorentz invariant,
because the energy, it represents, is
just one component of the covariant
energy-impulse vector.
</p>
<p>is used in most parts of fundamental physics. It is relatively simple,
</p>
<p>because the fundamental object, the Lagrangian, is a scalar3. The
</p>
<p>3 A scalar is an object transforming
according to the (0, 0) representation
of the Lorentz group. This means that
it does not change at all under Lorentz
transformations.
</p>
<p>formalism is extremely useful if we want to use symmetry consider-
</p>
<p>ations. If we demand the action, the integral over the Lagrangian, to

<p>4.1.1 Fermat&rsquo;s Principle
</p>
<p>"Whenever any action occurs in nature, the quantity of action em-
</p>
<p>ployed by this change is the least possible."
</p>
<p>- Pierre de Maupertius44 "Recherche des loix du mouvement"
(1746)
</p>
<p>The basic idea of the Lagrangian formalism emerged from Fer-
</p>
<p>mat&rsquo;s principle, which states that light always chooses the path q(t)
</p>
<p>between two points in space that minimizes the time it takes to travel
</p>
<p>between the points. To put this into mathematical terms, we define
</p>
<p>the action of a given path q(t) as
</p>
<p>Slight[q(t)] =
&int;
</p>
<p>dt
</p>
<p>and our task is then to find the specific path q(t) that minimizes the
</p>
<p>action5. To find the minimum6 of a given function f (x), we take the5 The action is here simply the integral
over the time for a specific path, i.e.
the total time. However, in general the
action will be a bit more complicated,
as we will see in a moment.
</p>
<p>6 In general, we want to find extrema,
which means minimums and maxi-
mums. The idea outlined in the next
section is capable of finding both. Nev-
ertheless, we will continue to talk about
minimums.
</p>
<p>derivative and set it to zero: f &prime;(x) != 0. The solutions of this equation
are the extrema of the functions. Here we want to find the minimum
</p>
<p>of a functional S[q(t)], which is a function S of a function q(t). To
</p>
<p>find the minimum of a functional, we need a new mathematical idea,
</p>
<p>called variational calculus.
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.1: Variations of a path with fixed
starting- and end-point.
</p>
<p>4.1.2 Variational Calculus - the Basic Idea
</p>
<p>If we want to develop a new theory capable of finding the minima of
</p>
<p>functionals, we need to take a step back and think about what charac-
</p>
<p>terises a mathematical minimum. The answer of variational calculus
</p>
<p>is that a minimum is characterised by its immediate neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s find the minimum xmin of an ordinary function
</p>
<p>f (x) = 3x2 + x. We start by looking at one specific x = a and take
</p>
<p>a close look at its neighborhood. Mathematically this means a + ǫ,
</p>
<p>where ǫ denotes an infinitesimal (positive or negative) variation. We
</p>
<p>put this variation around a into our function f (x):
</p>
<p>f (a + ǫ) = 3(a + ǫ)2 + (a + ǫ) = 3(a2 + 2aǫ+ ǫ2) + a + ǫ.
</p>
<p>Now the crucial observation is that if a is a minimum, first order
</p>
<p>variations in ǫ must vanish. Otherwise we can choose ǫ to be neg-
</p>
<p>ative ǫ &lt; 0 and then f (a + ǫ) is smaller than f (a). Therefore, we
</p>
<p>collect all terms linear in ǫ and demand that they vanish:
</p>
<p>3 &middot; 2aǫ+ ǫ != 0 &rarr; 6a + 1 != 0.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the framework 97
</p>
<p>This equation is solved by
</p>
<p>xmin = a =
&minus;1
6
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>This is, of course, exactly the same result that we get if we take the
</p>
<p>derivative f (x) = 3x2 + x &rarr; f &prime;(x) = 6x + 1 and demand this to be
zero. In terms of ordinary functions this is just another way of doing
</p>
<p>the same thing. However, variational calculus is additionally able to
</p>
<p>find the extrema of functionals. We will see in a moment how this
</p>
<p>works for a general action functional.
</p>
<p>The idea of the Lagrangian formalism is that a principle like the
</p>
<p>Fermat principle for light exists for massive objects, too. Unfortu-
</p>
<p>nately, massive objects do not simply obey Fermat&rsquo;s principle. Yet, we
</p>
<p>can try a more general ansatz
</p>
<p>S[q(t)] =
&int;
</p>
<p>L dt,
</p>
<p>where L is, in general, a non-constant function called the Lagrangian.
This function happens to be constant for light, but a general La-
</p>
<p>grangian is a function of the position q(t) of the object in question.
</p>
<p>In addition, the Lagrangian can depend on the velocity of the object:
</p>
<p>L = L(q(t), &part;&part;t q(t)). This will be discussed in more detail in the next
section7. Before we take a closer look at the usage of the variational 7 Our task will be to find the path q(t)
</p>
<p>with lowest possible action for a given
Lagrangian and given initial conditions.
Before we are able to do that, we
need to find the correct Lagrangian,
describing the physical system in
question. Here is where the symmetries
we talked about in the last chapters
come in handy. Demanding that the
Lagrangian is invariant under all
transformations of the Lorentz group,
will lead us to the correct Lagrangians.
</p>
<p>calculus idea for a functional like this, we need to talk about two
</p>
<p>small things.
</p>
<p>4.2 Restrictions
</p>
<p>As already noted in Chapter 1.1 there are restrictions to our present
</p>
<p>theories, that, so far, we can&rsquo;t motivate from first principles. We only
</p>
<p>know that we must respect them to get a sensible theory.
</p>
<p>One important restriction is that we are only allowed to use the
</p>
<p>lowest, non-trivial derivatives in the Lagrangian. Trivial in this con-
</p>
<p>text means with no influence of the dynamics of the system, i.e. on
</p>
<p>the equations of motion. For some theories this will be first order
</p>
<p>and for others second order derivatives. The lowest order of a given
</p>
<p>theory is determined by the condition that the Lagrangian must be
</p>
<p>Lorentz invariant8, because otherwise we would get different equa- 8 In fact, the action must be Lorentz
invariant, but if the Lagrangian is
Lorentz invariant, the action certainly
is, too.
</p>
<p>tions of motions for different frames of reference. For some theories
</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t get an invariant term with first order derivatives and there-
</p>
<p>fore second order derivatives are the lowest possible order.
</p>
<p>We simply do not know how to work with theories including
</p>
<p>higher order derivatives and there are deep systematic problems</p>

<p>we can write

</p>
<p>which shows that allowing an infinite number of derivatives would
</p>
<p>result in a non-local interaction theory.
</p>
<p>Another restriction is that in order to get a theory describing free
</p>
<p>(=non-interacting) fields/particles we must stop at second order in
</p>
<p>the field Φ(x). This means we only include the terms1212 From another perspective, this means
again that we only include the lowest
possible, non-trivial terms. Terms
with Φ0 and Φ1 do not lead to terms
proportional to Φ in the Lagrangian,
as we will see later and therefore we
use once more only the lowest possible,
non-trivial order, now in Φ.
</p>
<p>Φ0,Φ1,Φ2
</p>
<p>into our considerations. For example, a term of the form Φ2&part;μΦ is of
</p>
<p>third order in Φ and therefore not included in the Lagrangian for our
</p>
<p>free theory.
</p>
<p>4.3 Particle Theories vs. Field Theories
</p>
<p>Currently we have two frameworks to describe nature. On the one
</p>
<p>hand, we have particle theories that describe physical systems in
</p>
<p>terms of positions of particles depending on time, i.e. �q = �q(t). We
</p>
<p>use the symbol q instead of x, because there is no need to describe
</p>
<p>nature in terms of Cartesian coordinates13. For such theories the13 Another possibility are, for example,
spherical coordinates. Lagrangian depends on the position �q, the velocity &part;t�q and the time t:
</p>
<p>L = L(�q, &part;t�q, t). (4.3)
</p>
<p>A famous example is the Lagrangian L = 12m�̇q2, from which we
can derive Newton&rsquo;s equation of motion for classical mechanics. This
</p>
<p>will be discussed later in great detail.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have field theories that do not use the
</p>
<p>location �q(t) of individual particles to describe nature, but fields14. In
</p>
<p>14 An especially beautiful feature of
quantum field theory is how particles
emerge. In Chapter 6 we will see that
fields are able to create and destroy
particles.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the framework 99
</p>
<p>such theories space and time form the stage the fields Φ(�x, t) act on.
</p>
<p>Using the restrictions we get15 15 The usage of a different symbol L
here is intentional, because in field
theories we will work most of the time
with the Lagrangian density L . The
Lagrangian density is related to the
Lagrangian via L =
</p>
<p>&int;
d3xL .
</p>
<p>L = L (Φ(�x, t), &part;μΦ(�x, t),�x, t) (4.4)
</p>
<p>A famous example is the Lagrangian L = 12 (&part;μΦ&part;
μΦ &minus; m2Φ2),
</p>
<p>from which we will derive the Klein-Gordon equation.
</p>
<p>The big advantage of field theories is that they treat space and
</p>
<p>time on an equal footing. In a particle theory we use the space coor-
</p>
<p>dinates �q(t) to describe our particle as a function of time. Notably,
</p>
<p>there is no term like &part;�qt in the Lagrangian and if it would be there,
</p>
<p>how should we interpret it? It is clear what we mean when we talk
</p>
<p>about the location of a particle, but there is no obvious way to make
</p>
<p>sense of a similar sentence for time.
</p>
<p>Having discussed all this, we are able to return to the original
</p>
<p>minimizing problem, proposed at the beginning of this chapter. We
</p>
<p>want to find the minimum of some functional
</p>
<p>S[q(t)] =
&int;
</p>
<p>Ldt,
</p>
<p>which will give us the correct equations of motion.
</p>
<p>The solutions of these equations are for particles the correct paths
</p>
<p>that minimize the functional. For a field theory the solutions are the
</p>
<p>correct field configurations.
</p>
<p>For the moment, do not worry about the object L, because we
will describe in the following chapters in great detail how we can
</p>
<p>derive the correct Lagrangian L for the systems in question. Here, we
work with a general L and use the machinery of variational calculus,
introduced above, to derive the minimum of the functional S[q(t)].
</p>
<p>This minimization procedure will give us the equations of motion for
</p>
<p>the system.
</p>
<p>4.4 Euler-Lagrange Equation
</p>
<p>We start with particle theory and this means, we want to find out
</p>
<p>how a particle moves between two fixed points. The mathematical
</p>
<p>problem we have to solve is to find the function q(t) for which the
</p>
<p>action
</p>
<p>S =
&int; t2
</p>
<p>t1
L
</p>
<p>(
q(t),
</p>
<p>dq(t)
</p>
<p>dt
, t
</p>
<p>)
dt
</p>
<p>is an extremum (maximum or minimum). We use the notation
</p>
<p>q̇(t) &equiv; dq(t)
dt
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>100 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Analogous to the example above, we fix q(t) = a(t) and vary this
</p>
<p>particle path a little bit
</p>
<p>a(t) + ǫ(t)
</p>
<p>where ǫ is again infinitesimal. Considering a particle, we are not only
</p>
<p>able to vary the path, but in the same way we can vary the velocity
</p>
<p>ȧ(t) + ǫ̇(t) with ǫ̇(t) = dǫ(t)dt .
</p>
<p>At the boundary, the transformed path must be equivalent to the
</p>
<p>untransformed path:
</p>
<p>0 = ǫ(t1) = ǫ(t2), (4.5)
</p>
<p>because we are searching for the path between two fixed points that
</p>
<p>extremizes the action integral.
</p>
<p>This variation of the fixed function results in the functional
</p>
<p>S =
&int; t2
</p>
<p>t1
dtL(q + ǫ, q̇ + ǫ̇, t).
</p>
<p>Analogous to the example above, where we searched for the mini-
</p>
<p>mum of a function, we will demand here that the terms linear in the
</p>
<p>variation ǫ vanish. Because we work with a general L, we expand it
as Taylor series16 and demand that the first order terms vanish16 We are using a generalization of the
</p>
<p>formula, derived in Appendix B.3 for
functions with more than one variable:
L(q + ǫ, q̇ + ǫ̇, t) = L(q) + (q + ǫ&minus; q) &part;L&part;q
+(q̇ + ǫ̇&minus; q̇) &part;L&part;q̇ + . . .
= L(q) + ǫ &part;L&part;q + ǫ̇ &part;L&part;q̇ + . . .

= 0. (4.6)
</p>
<p>To proceed further, we need to find a way to bracket ǫ(t) out. This is
</p>
<p>necessary, because ǫ(t) is an arbitrary variation and when we bracket
</p>
<p>it out, we know that everything inside the brackets has to vanish if
</p>
<p>the total result is zero. So far we have one term that gets multiplied
</p>
<p>with ǫ(t) and a second term that gets multiplied with ddt ǫ(t). To
</p>
<p>bracket ǫ(t) out, we need get rid of the derivative. To achieve this, we
</p>
<p>integrate the last term by parts17, which yields17 Integration by parts is a direct conse-
quence of the product rule and derived
in Appendix B.2.

<p>the framework 101
</p>
<p>and we can see that this only vanishes for arbitrary variations ǫ(t)
</p>
<p>if the expression in the square bracket [ ] is identically zero. This
</p>
<p>yields18 18 Maybe you wonder about the two
different symbols for derivatives. ddt is
called the total derivative with respect
to t, whereas &part;&part;t is called the partial
derivative. The total derivative gives
us the total change, which is for a
function f given by sum of the change
rates, also known as partial derivatives,
times the change of the quantity itself.
For example, the total change of a
function f (x(t), y(t), z(t)) in three
</p>
<p>dimensional space is given by
d f
dt =
</p>
<p>&part; f
&part;x
</p>
<p>&part;x
&part;t +
</p>
<p>&part; f
&part;y
</p>
<p>&part;y
&part;t +
</p>
<p>&part; f
&part;z
</p>
<p>&part;z
&part;t +
</p>
<p>&part; f
&part;t
</p>
<p>&part;t
&part;t . The change
</p>
<p>rate times the distance it is changed.
In contrast the partial derivative is just
one part of this total change. For a
function that does not explicitly depend
on t the partial derivative is zero. For
example, for f (x(t), y(t)) = x2y + y3,
</p>
<p>we have
&part; f
&part;t = 0, but
</p>
<p>&part; f
&part;x = 2xy �= 0
</p>
<p>and
&part; f
&part;y = x
</p>
<p>2 + 3y2 �= 0. Therefore,
d f
dt = 2xy
</p>
<p>&part;x
&part;t + (x
</p>
<p>2 + 3y2) &part;y&part;t . In contrast
for another function g(x(t), y(t), t) =
</p>
<p>x2t + y we have &part;g&part;t = x

</p>

</p>
<p>)
= 0 , (4.7)
</p>
<p>which is the famous Euler-Lagrange equation.
</p>
<p>For a field theory we can follow a similar route. First notice that in
</p>
<p>this case we treat time and space equally. Therefore, we introduce the
</p>
<p>Lagrangian density L :
</p>
<p>L =
&int;
</p>
<p>d3xL (Φi, &part;μΦ
i) (4.8)
</p>
<p>and we can write the action in terms of this Lagrangian density
</p>
<p>S =
&int;
</p>
<p>dtL =
&int;
</p>
<p>d4xL (Φi, &part;μΦ
i) . (4.9)
</p>
<p>Following the same steps as above, we get the equations19 of motion
</p>
<p>19 Plural because we get one equa-
tion for each field component, i.e.
Φ1,Φ2, . . ..
</p>
<p>for a field theory:

<p>&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;Φi
&minus; &part;μ
</p>
<p>(
&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;(&part;μΦi)
</p>
<p>)
= 0 . (4.10)
</p>
<p>In the next section we will derive, using the Lagrangian formalism,
</p>
<p>one of the most important theorems of modern physics. We need
</p>
<p>this theorem to see the deep connection between symmetries and
</p>
<p>conserved quantities. The conserved quantities are the appropriate
</p>
<p>quantities20 to describe nature and from this theorem we learn how 20 We can see them as anchors in an
otherwise extremely complicated
world. While everything changes, the
conserved quantities stay the same.
</p>
<p>we can work with them in a theoretical context.
</p>
<p>4.5 Noether&rsquo;s Theorem
</p>
<p>Noether&rsquo;s theorem shows that each symmetry of the Lagrangian is
</p>
<p>directly related to one conserved quantity. Or formulated slightly
</p>
<p>different: The notions physicists commonly use to describe nature
</p>
<p>(the conserved quantities) are directly connected to symmetries. This
</p>
<p>is one of the most beautiful insights in the history of science.
</p>
<p>4.5.1 Noether&rsquo;s Theorem for Particle Theories
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at what we can say about conserved quantities in
</p>
<p>particle theories. We will restrict to continuous symmetries, because
</p>
<p>then we can look at infinitesimal changes. As we have seen in earlier
</p>
<p>chapters, we can build up finite changes by repetition of infinitesimal</p>

<p>Demanding that the Lagrangian is invariant can be too restrictive.
</p>
<p>What really needs to be invariant for the dynamics to stay the same
</p>
<p>is the action and not the Lagrangian. Of course, if the Lagrangian is
</p>
<p>invariant, the action is automatically invariant:

</p>
<p>How can the Lagrangian change, while the action stays the same? It
</p>
<p>turns out we can always add the total time derivative of a function G
</p>
<p>to the Lagrangian
</p>
<p>L &rarr; L+ dG
dt
</p>
<p>without changing the action, because2222 Using δG = &part;G&part;q δq, because G = G(q)
and we vary q. Therefore the variation
of G is given by the rate of change &part;G&part;q
times the variation of q.

</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>In the last step, we use that the variation δq vanishes at the initial and
</p>
<p>final times (t1, t2). We conclude, there is no need for us to demand
</p>
<p>that the variation of the Lagrangian δL vanishes, rather we have the
less restrictive condition
</p>
<p>δL != dG
dt
</p>
<p>. (4.13)
</p>
<p>This means the Lagrangian can change in this way without chang-
</p>
<p>ing the action. Therefore the equation of motion stay the same even
</p>
<p>though the Lagrangian changes, as long as the change can be written
</p>
<p>as total derivative of some function: dGdt . Rewriting Eq. 4.11, now with

<p>104 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>We now want to look at rotations and therefore need more than
</p>
<p>one dimension, because a rotation in one dimension makes no sense.
</p>
<p>It is useful to use an index notation instead of the usual vector no-
</p>
<p>tation here, because then we can simply rewrite all equations with
</p>
<p>q &rarr; qi to be able to incorporate changes in more than one dimension.
Let&rsquo;s have a look at an infinitesimal rotation28 qi &rarr; q&prime;i = qi + ǫijkqjak28 Here we write the generator of
</p>
<p>rotations by using the Levi-Civita
symbol. This was explained in the text
below Eq. 3.62.
</p>
<p>and therefore δqi = ǫijkqjak. Our Lagrangian is invariant under such
</p>
<p>transformations, because again, L = 12m�̇q2 does not depend on q, and
the corresponding conserved quantity is29
</p>
<p>29 This was derived in Eq. 4.16, again we
work here with G = 0.
</p>
<p>Jrot =
&part;L(qi, q̇i, t)
</p>
<p>&part;q̇i
δqi =
</p>
<p>&part;L(qi, q̇i, t)
&part;q̇i

<p>= mq̇iǫijkqjak = piǫijkqjak
</p>
<p>&rarr; Jrot = (�p &times;�q) &middot;�a &equiv; �L &middot;�a . (4.21)
</p>
<p>In the last step we rewrite our term in vector notation, where &times; is
called the cross product and �L is what we usually call angular mo-
</p>
<p>mentum in classical mechanics. Therefore, invariance under rota-
</p>
<p>tions leads us to conservation of angular momentum.
</p>
<p>Next let&rsquo;s have a look at invariance under time translations30. An30 This means that physics doesn&rsquo;t care

<p>To summarize for particle theories we have the following connec-

</p>
<p>&bull; translational invariance in space &rArr; conservation of momentum,
&bull; boost invariance31 &rArr; conservation of p̃t &minus; mq, 31 Another name for a boost is transla-

momentum to mq̇ &rarr; m(q̇ + v).

<p>&bull; rotational invariance &rArr; conservation of angular momentum,

Noether&rsquo;s theorem shows us why these notions32 are used in every 32 Except for the conserved quantity

</p>
<p>have the usual spacetime symmetries of our physical laws, we have
</p>
<p>momentum, energy and angular momentum as conserved quantities.
</p>
<p>It is instructive to repeat the above discussion for field theories.
</p>
<p>In field theories we have two kinds of symmetries. On the one hand,
</p>
<p>our Lagrangian can be invariant under spacetime transformations,
</p>
<p>which means a transformation like a rotation. On the other hand, we
</p>
<p>can have invariance under transformations of the field itself, which
</p>
<p>are called internal symmetries.
</p>
<p>4.5.2 Noether&rsquo;s Theorem for Field Theories - Spacetime
</p>
<p>Symmetries
</p>
<p>For fields one has to distinguish between different kinds of changes
</p>
<p>that can happen under spacetime transformations. Observer S&prime; sees</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>106 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>the field Ψ&prime;(x&prime;) whereas observer S sees the field Ψ(x). This is the
same field, just from another perspective and the two observers do
</p>
<p>not see the same numerical field components. The two different
</p>
<p>descriptions are related by the appropriate transformations of the
</p>
<p>Lorentz group. We introduced in Section 3.7.11 the field representa-
</p>
<p>tion, which we will be using now. The (infinite-dimensional) differ-
</p>
<p>ential operator representation changes x &rarr; x&prime;. This means by using
this representation we can compute the field components at a differ-
</p>
<p>ent point in spacetime or in a rotated frame. The finite-dimensional
</p>
<p>representation of the Lorentz group changes Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime;, i.e. mixes the
field components33.33 Remember for example, that a Weyl
</p>
<p>spinor has two- and a vector field
has four-components. If we look at
</p>
<p>the vector field Aμ =

μ and
</p>
<p>Aμ describe the same field in coordinate
systems that are rotated by 90◦ around
the z-axis relative to each other.
</p>
<p>A complete transformation, for a field that depends on spacetime,
</p>
<p>needs to consist of both parts. We will look at these parts separately,
</p>
<p>starting with the change x &rarr; x&prime;. For rotations the conserved quantity
that follows is not really conserved, because we neglected the second
</p>
<p>part of the transformation, i.e. the mixing of the field components.
</p>
<p>Only the sum of the two conserved quantities that follow from x &rarr;
x&prime; and Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime; is conserved.
</p>
<p>To make this more concrete consider a general Lagrangian density
</p>
<p>L ((Φ(xμ), &part;μΦ(xμ), xμ). Symmetry means we have
</p>
<p>L ((Φ(xμ), &part;μΦ(xμ), xμ) = L ((Φ
&prime;(x&prime;μ), &part;μΦ
</p>
<p>&prime;(x&prime;μ), x
&prime;
μ). (4.26)
</p>
<p>In general, the total change of a function-of-a-function, when the
</p>
<p>independent functions are changed and the point at which they are
</p>
<p>evaluated is also changed, is given by3434 If this is new to you: This is often
called the total derivative. The total
change is given by the sum of the
change rates, also known as derivatives,
times the change of the quantity itself.
For example, the total change of a
function f (x, y, z) in three dimensional
</p>
<p>space is given by
&part; f
&part;x δx +
</p>
<p>&part; f
&part;y δy +
</p>
<p>&part; f
&part;z δz.
</p>
<p>The change rate times the distance it
is changed. We consider infinitesimal
changes and therefore this can be
seen as the first terms in the Taylor
expansion, where we can neglect higher
order terms.

<p>Sμν enables us to work with the generators of rotations and boosts at

<p>the same time.
</p>
<p>The first part is only important for rotations and boosts, because
</p>
<p>translations do not mix the field components. For boosts the con-
</p>
<p>served quantity will not be very enlightening, just as in the particle
</p>
<p>case, so in fact this term will become only relevant for rotational
</p>
<p>symmetry.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the simplest field transformation: a translation in
</p>
<p>spacetime
</p>
<p>xμ &rarr; x&prime;μ = xμ + δxμ = xμ + aμ. (4.31)
For translations we have ǫμν = 0, because field components do not
</p>
<p>mix under translations and therefore Eq. 4.30 reads
</p>
<p>δΦ = &minus; &part;Φ
&part;xμ
</p>
<p>δxμ .
</p>
<p>Thus if we want to investigate the consequences of invariance (δL = 0),
</p>
<p>we get from Eq. 4.29
</p>
<p>&minus;&part;ν

δxμ = 0 . (4.33)
</p>
<p>From Eq. 4.31 we have δxμ = aμ, which we now put into Eq. 4.33.

<p>Equation 4.34 tells us that each component μ of Tνμ fulfils a continuity

<p>We defined a four-vector with a

</p>
<p>T and a
four-vector with an upper index as
Bμ &equiv; ημνBν = (B0,&minus;B1,&minus;B2,&minus;B3)T .
The minus signs here are a result of
the minus signs in the Minkowski

The reason for the plus sign in
Eq. 4.37 is that &part;μ is defined as

<p>In the last step we use that if we have an infinite volume V, like

<p>a sphere with infinite radius r, and we have to integrate over the
</p>
<p>surface of this volume δV, we need to evaluate our fields at r = &infin;.
</p>
<p>Fields must vanish at infinity, because otherwise the total field energy
</p>
<p>would be infinite and field configurations with infinite energy are
</p>
<p>non-physical38.38 Take note that strictly speaking this is
only true for spin 0 and spin 1/2 fields.
For spin 1 fields, only the field-strength
tensor Fμν must vanish to guarantee
finite energy, while the "basic fields" Aμ
(with Fμν := &part;μAν &minus; &part;νAμ) can be non-
zero "at infinity". (The field strength
tensor will be defined in Eq. 6.23).
This observation leads to the non-
trivial vacuum picture in non-abelian
gauge theories. Unfortunately, a proper
discussion lies far beyond the scope of
this book.
</p>
<p>We conclude: the invariance under translations in spacetime leads
</p>
<p>us to 4 conserved quantities39, one for each component μ . Equation

<p>E =

</p>
<p>d3xT00 (4.40)
</p>
<p>Pi =
&int;
</p>
<p>d3xT0i , (4.41)
</p>
<p>where as always i = 1, 2, 3. These quantities are called the total en-
</p>
<p>ergy E of the system, which is conserved because we have invariance
</p>
<p>under time-translations x0 &rarr; x0 + a0 and the total momentum
of the field configuration Pi, which is conserved because we have
</p>
<p>invariance under spatial-translations xi &rarr; xi + ai.
</p>
<p>4.5.3 Rotations and Boosts
</p>
<p>Next, we take a look at invariance under rotations and boosts. We
</p>
<p>will start with the second part of Eq. 4.30 and then look afterwards
</p>
<p>at the implications of the first part. We will get a quantity from the
</p>
<p>first part and a quantity from the second part, which are together
</p>
<p>conserved. A scalar field has no components that could mix, hence
</p>
<p>for a scalar field the first part is zero. In other words, for scalars we
</p>
<p>use the 1-dimensional representation of the generators of the Lorentz
</p>
<p>group Sμν = 0, which was derived in Section 3.7.4. Therefore what
</p>
<p>we derive in this section is the complete conserved quantity for a
</p>
<p>scalar field.</p>

The quantity Jν we introduced in the last step is called Noether

<p>current. Note that, because of the anti-symmetry of Mμσ = &minus;Mσμ,
which follows from the definition in Eq. 3.173, we have Mμμ = 0.
</p>
<p>Therefore, we found 6 different continuity equations &part;ν(Jν) = 0, one

<p>for each non-vanishing Mμσ. With the same arguments from Eq. 4.39

in a moment, because actually this is
just one part of the complete angular
momentum. We will have a look at the

<p>Equivalently, we have the conserved quantity for boosts42

<p>4.5.4 Spin
</p>
<p>Next, we want to take a look at the implications of the first part of
</p>
<p>Eq. 4.30, which is what we missed in our previous derivation of the
</p>
<p>conserved quantity that follows from rotations. We now consider
</p>
<p>δΦ = ǫμνS
μνΦ(x), (4.48)
</p>
<p>where Sμν is the appropriate finite-dimensional representation of the
</p>
<p>transformation in question43. This gives us in Eq. 4.29 the extra term43 The finite-dimensional representa-
tions are responsible for the mixing of
the field components. For example, the
two dimensional representation of the
rotation generators: Ji =

</p>
<p>components of Weyl spinors.

<p>&part;(&part;ρΦ)

</p>
<p>μνΦ(x)
</p>
<p>)
, (4.49)
</p>
<p>which leads to an additional term in Eq. 4.46. The complete con-
</p>
<p>served quantity then reads

</p>
<p>The first part is something new, but needs to be similar to the
</p>
<p>usual orbital angular momentum we previously considered, because
</p>
<p>the two terms are added and appear when considering the same
</p>
<p>invariance. The standard point of view is that the first part of this
</p>
<p>conserved quantity is some-kind of internal angular momentum44.44 We will see later that fields create
and destroy particles. A spin 12 field
</p>
<p>creates spin 12 particles, which is an un-
changeable property of an elementary
particle. Hence the usage of the word
"internal". Orbital angular momentum
is a quantity that describes how two
or more particles revolve around each
other.
</p>
<p>Recall that we label the representations of the Poincar&eacute; group by
</p>
<p>something we call spin, too. Now this notion appears again. We will
</p>
<p>learn in the next chapter and in great detail in Section 8.5.5, how we
</p>
<p>are able to measure this new kind of angular momentum, called spin
</p>
<p>and see later that it indeed coincides with the label we use for the

<p>representations of the Poincar&eacute; group.

</p>
<p>We now take a look at internal symmetries45. The invariance of a45 Internal symmetries will be incredibly
important for interacting field theories.
In addition, one conserved quantity,
following from one of the easiest
internal symmetries will provide us
with the starting point for quantum
field theory.

<p>(
&part;L

<p>&part;(&part;μΦi)
δΦi
</p>
<p>)

</p>
<p>This means, if the Lagrangian is invariant under the transforma-
</p>
<p>tion Φi &rarr; Φ&prime;i = Φi + δΦi, we get again a quantity, called Noether
current
</p>
<p>Jμ &equiv; &part;L

<p>derive a quantity that is conserved in time

<p>&part;t
</p>
<p>&int;
d3xJ0 = 0. (4.57)
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at one very important example: invariance under
</p>
<p>displacements of the field itself46, which means δΦ = &minus;iǫ in Eq. 4.52: 46 Take note that at this point we made
no assumptions about the field being
complex or real. The constant ǫ is arbi-
trary and could be entirely imaginary
if we want to move our field by a real
value. The i is included at this point to
make the generator Hermitian (which is
by no means obvious at this point) and
therefore the eigenvalues real, as will be
shown later. Don&rsquo;t get confused at this
point. You could simply see this extra i
as a convention, because we could just
as well absorb it into the constant by
defining ǫ&prime; := iǫ.
</p>
<p>Φ &rarr; Φ&prime; = Φ &minus; iǫ (4.58)
or for more than one field component
</p>
<p>Φi &rarr; Φ&prime;i = Φi &minus; iǫi. (4.59)
The generator of this transformation is &minus;i &part;&part;Φ , because
</p>
<p>Φ&prime; = e&minus;iǫ

&part;Φ Φ =

<p>)
Φ &asymp; Φ &minus; iǫ (4.60)
</p>
<p>The corresponding conserved quantity is called conjugate momen-
</p>
<p>tum Π. With Eq. 4.54 and Eq. 4.57 we get47 47 The δΦ in Eq. 4.55 becomes a constant
ǫ and because the quantity is conserved
for arbitrary ǫ we define our conserved
quantity without it.</p>

<p>4.6 Appendix: Conserved Quantity from Boost
</p>
<p>Invariance for Particle Theories
</p>
<p>In this appendix we want to find the conserved quantity that follows
</p>
<p>for our example Lagrangian L = 12m�̇q2 from boost invariance. A
boost transformation is q &rarr; q&prime; = q + δq = q + vt, where v denotes a
constant velocity. Our Lagrangian is not invariant under boosts, but
</p>
<p>this is no problem at all, as we have seen above:
</p>
<p>For our equations of motion to be unchanged under transformations
</p>
<p>the Lagrangian is allowed to change up to the total derivative of an
</p>
<p>arbitrary function. This condition is clearly fulfilled for our boost
</p>
<p>transformation q &rarr; q&prime; = q + vt &rArr;︸︷︷︸
v=const!
</p>
<p>q̇&prime; = q̇ + v and therefore our
</p>
<p>Lagrangian
</p>
<p>L = 1
2
</p>
<p>mq̇2
</p>
<p>is changed by
</p>
<p>δL = L(q, q̇, t)&minus;L(q&prime;, q̇&prime;, t) = 1
2
</p>
<p>mq̇2 &minus; 1

</p>
<p>mq̇&prime;2

</p>
<p>2
mq̇2 &minus; 1
</p>
<p>2
m(q̇ + v)2 = &minus;mq̇v &minus; 1
</p>
<p>2
mv2,
</p>
<p>which is the total derivative of the function53 53 dGdt =

dt (&minus;mqv &minus; 12 mv2t) = &minus;mq̇v &minus;

</p>
<p>2, because v and m are constant.
</p>
<p>&minus;G &equiv; &minus;mqv &minus; 1
2
</p>
<p>mv2t.
</p>
<p>We conclude that our equations of motion stay unchanged and we
</p>
<p>can find a conserved quantity54. 54 Another way to see this is by looking
directly at the equation of motion:
mq̈ = 0. We have the transformation
</p>
<p>q &rarr; q&prime; = q + vt, with v =const
and therefore q̇ &rarr; q̇&prime; = q̇ + v and
q̈ &rarr; q̈&prime; = q̈.
</p>
<p>For boosts, the conserved quantity is (Eq. 4.16)
</p>
<p>Jboost =
&part;L
&part;q̇︸︷︷︸
&equiv;p
</p>
<p>δq︸︷︷︸
=vt
</p>
<p>&minus;G = pvt &minus; mvq &minus; 1
2
</p>
<p>mv2t,
</p>
<p>where we can cancel one v from every term, because in Eq. 4.16 we
</p>
<p>have a zero on the right hand side. This gives us
</p>
<p>J̃boost = pt &minus;
1

<p>2
mvt
</p>
<p>︸ ︷︷ ︸
&equiv; p̃t
</p>
<p>&minus;mq = p̃t &minus; mq . (4.62)
</p>
<p>This is a rather strange conserved quantity because its value de-
</p>
<p>pends on the starting time. We can choose a suitable zero time, which
</p>
<p>makes this quantity zero. Because it is conserved, this zero stays zero
</p>
<p>for all times.</p>

</p>
<p>From Eq. 4.20 we know that Pi is conserved &part;P

<p>&part;t = 0 &rarr; Pi = const.
and we can conclude
</p>
<p>&part;
</p>
<p>&part;t
</p>
<p>&int;
d3xT00xi = Pi = const. (4.64)
</p>
<p>Therefore this conservation law tells us55 that the center of energy55 Don&rsquo;t worry about the meaning of
this term too much, because this isn&rsquo;t
really a useful conserved quantity like
the others we derived so far.
</p>
<p>travels with constant velocity. Or from a different perspective: The
</p>
<p>momentum equals the total energy times the velocity of the centre-of-
</p>
<p>mass energy.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the conserved quantity derived in Eq. 4.47 remains
</p>
<p>strange. By a suitable choice of the starting time the quantity can be
</p>
<p>chosen to be zero. Because it is conserved, this zero stays zero in all

<p>instances.</p>

<p>Measuring Nature
</p>
<p>Now that we have discovered the connection between symmetries
</p>
<p>and conserved quantities, we can utilize this connection. In more
</p>
<p>technical terms, Noether&rsquo;s Theorem establishes a connection between
</p>
<p>the generator of a symmetry transformation and a conserved quan-
</p>
<p>tity. In this chapter we will utilize this connection.
</p>
<p>Conserved quantities are what physicists commonly use to de-
</p>
<p>scribe physical systems, because no matter how complicated the
</p>
<p>system changes, the conserved quantities stay the same. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, to describe what is happening in an experiment physicists use
</p>
<p>the momentum, energy and angular momentum. Noether&rsquo;s theorem
</p>
<p>hints us towards an incredibly important idea:
</p>
<p>We identify the quantities that we use to describe nature with the
</p>
<p>corresponding generators:
</p>
<p>physical quantity &rArr; generator of the corresponding symmetry. (5.1)
</p>
<p>As we will see, this identification naturally guide us towards quan-
</p>
<p>tum theory. Let&rsquo;s make this concrete by considering a particle theory.
</p>
<p>5.1 The Operators of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>The invariance of the Lagrangian under the action of the generator
</p>
<p>of spatial-translations leads us to the conservation of momentum.
</p>
<p>Therefore, we make the identification
</p>
<p>momentum p̂i &rarr; generator of spatial-translations &minus; i&part;i
</p>
<p>It is conventional to use a hat: Ô to denote an operator.
</p>
<p>Analogously, the invariance under the action of the generator
</p>
<p>of time-translations leads us to the conservation of energy. Conse-

<p>&radic;
m2 + p2. In the non-relativistic
</p>
<p>limit c &rarr; &infin; we get E &asymp; m and therefore
recover the formula we derived for a
Galilei boost from the Lorentz boost
conserved quantity. The conserved
quantity for a particle theory is then
Mi = (tpi &minus; xiE) . The generator of
boosts is (see Eq. 3.248 with Ki = M0i)
Ki = i(x0&part;i &minus; xi&part;0). Comparing the two
equations, with of course x0 = t, yields
Mi = (tpi &minus; xiE) &harr; Ki = i(t&part;i &minus; xi&part;0)
The identification is now, with the
identifications we made earlier, straight-
forward. Location x̂i &rarr; xi .
</p>
<p>location x̂i &rarr; xi.
</p>
<p>The physical quantities we want to use in our theory to describe
</p>
<p>nature are now given by (differential) operators. The logical next
</p>
<p>thing to ask is: What do they act on and where is the connection to
</p>
<p>things we can measure in experiments? We will discuss this in a later
</p>
<p>chapter in detail. At this point it is sufficient to note that our physical
</p>
<p>quantities, now operators, need to act on something. Here we want to
</p>
<p>move on with an abstract thing that the operators act on. Let&rsquo;s name
</p>
<p>it Ψ. We will explore later what this something is.
</p>
<p>At this point, we are able to derive one of the most important2
</p>
<p>2 If you don&rsquo;t know anything about
quantum mechanics, it may seem
strange to you why this little equation
is so important, but maybe you have
heard of the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle. In Section 8.3 we will take a
closer look at the formalism of quantum
mechanics. Then we will be able to see
that this equation tells us that we aren&rsquo;t
able to measure the momentum and
the location of a particle with arbitrary
precision. Our physical quantities are
interpreted as measurement opera-
tors and this equation tells us that a
measurement of location followed by a
measurement of momentum is not the
same as a measurement of momentum
followed by a measurement of location.
</p>
<p>equations of quantum mechanics. As explained above, we assume
</p>
<p>that our operators act on something abstract Ψ. Then we have
</p>
<p>[ p̂i, x̂j]Ψ = ( p̂i x̂j &minus; x̂j p̂i)Ψ = (&minus;i&part;i x̂j + x̂ji&part;i)Ψ

</p>
<p>This equation holds for arbitrary Ψ, because we made no assump-
</p>
<p>tions about it and therefore we can write the equation without Ψ3:
</p>
<p>3 If this is a new idea to you, take note
that we could rewrite every vector
equation as an equation that involves
only numbers. For example Newton&rsquo;s
second law: �F = m�̈x, could be written
as �F�C = m�̈x�C, which is certainly true
for any vector �C. Nevertheless, if the
equation is true for any �C, writing it all
the time makes little sense.

</p>
<p>5.1.1 Spin and Angular Momentum
</p>
<p>In the last chapter (Section 4.5.4) we saw that the conserved quan-
</p>
<p>tity that resulted from rotational invariance has two parts. The sec-
</p>
<p>ond part was identified with the orbital angular momentum and
</p>
<p>we therefore make the identification with the infinite dimensional

</p>
<p>j&part;k &minus; xk&part;j)
</p>
<p>Analogously we identify the first part, called spin, with the corre-
</p>
<p>sponding finite dimensional representation of the generators4
</p>
<p>4 Recall that this was the part of the
conserved quantity that resulted from
the invariance under mixing of the
field components. Hence the finite-
dimensional representation.

</p>
<p>As explained in the text below Eq. 4.30 the relation between Sμν and

</p>
<p>For example, when we consider a spin 12 field, we have to use the

<p>Ŝi = i

</p>
<p>where once more σi denotes the Pauli matrices. We will return to
</p>
<p>this very interesting and very strange type of angular momentum in
</p>
<p>Section 8.5.5, after we learned how to work with the operators that
</p>
<p>we derive in this chapter. It is important to keep in mind that only
</p>
<p>the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum is conserved.
</p>
<p>5.2 The Operators of Quantum Field Theory
</p>
<p>The central objects in a field theory are, of course, fields. A field is
</p>
<p>a function of the location in space and time5 Φ = Φ(x). Later we 5 Here x = x0, x1, x2, x3 includes time
x0 = t.want to describe interactions at points in spacetime and therefore
</p>
<p>work with the densities of our dynamical variables π = π(x) and not
</p>
<p>the total quantities that we get by integrating the densities over all
</p>
<p>space Π =
&int;
</p>
<p>dx3π(x) �= Π(x).
</p>
<p>We discovered in the last chapter for invariance under displace-
</p>
<p>ments of the field itself Φ &rarr; Φ &minus; iǫ a new conserved quantity, called
conjugate momentum Π. Analogous to the identifications we made
</p>
<p>in the last section, we identify the conjugate momentum density with
</p>
<p>the corresponding generator (Eq. 4.60)
</p>
<p>conj. mom. density π(x) &rarr; gen. of displ. of the field itself : &minus; i &part;
&part;Φ(x)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>We could now go on, like we did for a particle theory, and identify
</p>
<p>momentum, angular momentum and energy with the corresponding
</p>
<p>generators. However, we will see later that quantum field theory
</p>
<p>works a little differently and the identification we make here will
</p>
<p>prove to be sufficient.
</p>
<p>For the same reasons discussed in the last section, we need some-
</p>
<p>thing our operators act on. Thus again, we work again with an ab-
</p>
<p>stract Ψ, that we will specify in a later chapter. We are then again
</p>
<p>able to derive an incredibly important equation, this time of quantum
</p>
<p>field theory6 6 For the last step we use the analogue
to &part;xi&part;xj
</p>
<p>= δij for the delta distribution

<p>&part; f (xi)
&part; f (xj)

<p>= δ(xi &minus; xj), which can be shown
in a rigorous way. For some more infor-
mation have a look at Appendix D.2.

<p>Free Theory
</p>
<p>In this chapter we will derive the basic equations for a physical the-
</p>
<p>ory of free (=non-interacting) fields1 from symmetry. We will 1 Although we specify here for fields
we will see in a later chapter how the
equations we derive here can be used to
describe particles, too.

</p>
<p>the Lorentz group,
</p>
<p>&bull; derive the Dirac equation using the ( 12 , 0)&oplus; (0, 12 ) representation of
the Lorentz group,
</p>
<p>&bull; derive the Proca equations from the vector ( 12 ,
1
2 ) representation of
</p>
<p>the Lorentz group which in the massless limit become the famous
</p>
<p>Maxwell equations.
</p>
<p>6.1 Lorentz Covariance and Invariance
</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will derive the fundamental equations
</p>
<p>of motion of the standard model of particle physics, which is the best
</p>
<p>physical theory that we have. We want that these equations are the
</p>
<p>same in all inertial frames, because otherwise would have a different
</p>
<p>equation for each possible frame of reference. This would be useless
</p>
<p>because there is no preferred frame of reference in special relativity.
</p>
<p>The technical term for an equation that looks the same in all iner-
</p>
<p>tial frames of reference is Lorentz covariant equation. An object is
</p>
<p>Lorentz covariant if it transforms under a given representation of
</p>
<p>the Lorentz group. For example, a vector Aμ, transforms according
</p>
<p>to the ( 12 ,
1
2 ) representation and is therefore Lorentz covariant. This
</p>
<p>means Aμ &rarr; A&prime;μ, but not something completely different. On the
other hand, for example, a term of the form A1 + A3 is not Lorentz
</p>
<p>covariant, because it does not transform according to a representation
</p>
<p>of the Lorentz group. This does not mean that we do not know how
</p>
<p>it transforms. The transformation properties can be easily derived
</p>
<p>from the transformation laws for Aμ, but nevertheless this term looks

</p>
<p>completely different in different inertial frames. In a boosted frame,
</p>
<p>it may look like A2 + A4. An equation that involves only Lorentz
</p>
<p>covariant objects is called a Lorentz covariant equation. For example,
</p>
<p>Aμ + 7Bμ + CνA
νDμ = 0
</p>
<p>is a Lorentz covariant equation, because in another coordinate system
</p>
<p>it reads

<p>&prime;
μ + C
</p>
<p>&prime;
νA
</p>
<p>&prime;νD&prime;μ = 0.
</p>
<p>We see that it looks the same. An equation containing only some
</p>
<p>components of such objects is, in general, not Lorentz covariant and
</p>
<p>therefore looks completely different in each inertial frame.
</p>
<p>To make sure we only end up with Lorentz covariant equations,
</p>
<p>we require the action S to be Lorentz invariant. This means it should
</p>
<p>only contain terms that stay exactly the same when changing the
</p>
<p>frame of reference. In other words: The action is only allowed to con-
</p>
<p>tain terms that do not change under Lorentz transformations. We get
</p>
<p>the equations of motion from the action2 S. Now if S depends on the2 Recall that we minimize the action and
the result of this minimization proce-
dure is the Euler-Lagrange equation,
which yields the equation of motion for
our system.
</p>
<p>frame of reference, so would the terms in the equations that follow
</p>
<p>from it and therefore these equations can not be Lorentz covariant.
</p>
<p>As already discussed in the last chapter, we can use the more
</p>
<p>restrictive requirement that the Lagrangian should be invariant, be-
</p>
<p>cause if the Lagrangian is invariant the action is, too.
</p>
<p>6.2 Klein-Gordon Equation
</p>
<p>We now start with the simplest possible case: scalars, which trans-
</p>
<p>form according to the (0, 0) representation of the Lorentz group. To
</p>
<p>specify the equation of motion for scalars we need to find the corre-
</p>
<p>sponding Lagrangian. A general Lagrangian that is compatible with
</p>
<p>our restrictions3 is3 Discussed in Section 4.2: We only con-
sider terms of order 0, 1 and 2 in Φ. The
term with the lowest possible derivative
will become clear in a moment.
</p>
<p>L = AΦ0 + BΦ + CΦ2 + D&part;μΦ + E&part;μΦ&part;
μΦ + FΦ&part;μΦ . (6.1)
</p>
<p>Firstly, take note that we are considering the Lagrangian density
</p>
<p>L and not L itself and we get our physical theory from the action
</p>
<p>S =
&int;
</p>
<p>dxL , (6.2)
</p>
<p>where dx is to be understood as the integral over space and time.
</p>
<p>Therefore a term like Φ&part;μ&part;
μΦ would be redundant, because it is
</p>
<p>equivalent to the term &part;μΦ&part;
μΦ, as we can see if we integrate by
</p>
<p>parts4.4 The boundary terms, as usual, vanish,
because fields vanish at infinity. Recall
that this follows, because field config-
urations that do not vanish at infinity
correspond to infinite field energy,
which is non-physical (Section 2.3).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>free theory 123
</p>
<p>In addition, Lorentz invariance restricts the Lagrangian to be a
</p>
<p>scalar. Therefore, all odd powers in &part;μ, like in &part;μΦ are forbidden.
</p>
<p>What about the constants i.e. a and c etc. having a Lorentz index?
</p>
<p>This would mean that a, c are four-vectors, specifying a direction
</p>
<p>in spacetime and therefore violating the assumption of isotropy of
</p>
<p>space. We can neglect the constant term, i.e. A = 0, because we get
</p>
<p>our physical theory from the Euler-Lagrange equation and a constant
</p>
<p>in the Lagrangian has no influence on the equation of motion5. In 5 See Eq. 4.10: &part;L&part;Φ &minus; &part;μ
(
</p>
<p>&part;L
&part;(&part;μΦ)
</p>
<p>)
= 0
</p>
<p>and therefore L &rarr; L + A with
some constant A does not change
</p>
<p>anything:
&part;(L+A)
</p>
<p>&part;Φ &minus; &part;μ
(
</p>
<p>&part;(L+A)
&part;(&part;μΦ)
</p>
<p>)
=
</p>
<p>&part;L
&part;Φ &minus; &part;μ
</p>
<p>(
&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;(&part;μΦ)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>addition, we ignore the term linear in Φ, i.e. B = 0, because it leads,
</p>
<p>using the Euler-Lagrange equation, to a constant in our equations
</p>
<p>of motion6. At least in a free theory, the absolute value of the field
</p>
<p>6 L &rarr; L + BΦ yields
&part;(L+BΦ)
</p>
<p>&part;Φ &minus; &part;μ
(
</p>
<p>&part;(L+BΦ)
&part;(&part;μΦ)
</p>
<p>)
= &part;L&part;Φ &minus;
</p>
<p>&part;μ
(
</p>
<p>&part;L
&part;(&part;μΦ)
</p>
<p>)
+ B = 0, which is just an
</p>
<p>additional constant in the equation of
motion.
</p>
<p>has no relevance and thus we can always perform a redefinition
</p>
<p>Φ &rarr; Φ&prime; = Φ + const. such that the constant term vanishes from the
equation of motion7. What remains is
</p>
<p>7 However take note that if the field
interacts with other fields, this is no
longer true, because such a field shift
then also affects the terms that de-
scribe the coupling between the fields.
This will be discussed in detail in Sec-
tion. 7.3 in the context of spontaneous
symmetry breaking.
</p>
<p>L = CΦ2 + E&part;μΦ&part;
μΦ . (6.3)
</p>
<p>As the heading of this chapter indicates we want to develop a free
</p>
<p>theory, which means there is just one Φ and no terms of the form
</p>
<p>Φ1Φ2. Terms like this will be investigated in the next chapter, when
</p>
<p>we develop a theory describing interactions.
</p>
<p>There is one last thing to note: we are left with only two constants
</p>
<p>C and E. By using variational calculus we are able to combine these
</p>
<p>into just one constant, because an overall constant in the Lagrangian
</p>
<p>has no influence on the physics8. Nevertheless, it is conventional to 8 L &rarr; CL yields

see that it coincides with the mass of
particles described by this Lagrangian.

<p>6.2.1 Complex Klein-Gordon Field
</p>
<p>For spin 0 fields, we are able to construct a Lorentz invariant La-
</p>
<p>grangian without using the complex conjugate of the scalar field.
</p>
<p>This will not be the case for spin 12 fields Ψ and this curious fact will
</p>
<p>have very interesting consequences10. Nevertheless, nothing prevents10 To spoil the surprise: there is an an-
tiparticle for each spin 12 particle. Using
complex fields is the same as consid-
ering two fields at the same time as
explained in the text below. Therefore
we are forced by Lorentz invariance to
use two (closely connected) fields at
the same time, which are commonly
interpreted as particle and antiparticle
fields.
</p>
<p>us from investigating the equally Lorentz invariant Lagrangian
</p>
<p>L = &part;μφ
&dagger;&part;μφ&minus; m2φ&dagger;φ
</p>
<p>as many textbooks do. This is simply the same as investigating two
</p>
<p>scalar fields of equal mass at the same time

</p>
<p>because we have
</p>
<p>φ &equiv; 1&radic;
2
(φ1 + iφ2) .
</p>
<p>Again Lorentz symmetry dictates the form of the Lagrangian. Ele-
</p>
<p>mentary scalar (=spin 0) particles are very rare. In fact, only one is
</p>
<p>experimentally verified: the Higgs boson. However this Lagrangian
</p>
<p>can also be used to describe composite systems like mesons. We will
</p>
<p>not investigate this Lagrangian any further and most textbooks use it
</p>
<p>only for "training purposes".
</p>
<p>6.3 Dirac Equation
</p>
<p>Another story told of Dirac is that when he first met Richard Feynman,
</p>
<p>he said after a long silence "I have an equation. Do you have one too?"
</p>
<p>- Anthony Zee1111 Anthony Zee. Quantum Field Theory in
a Nutshell. Princeton University Press,
1st edition, 3 2003. ISBN 9780691010199
</p>
<p>In this section we want to find the equation of motion for free spin 12
fields/particles. We will use the ( 12 , 0)&oplus; (0, 12 ) representation of the
Lorentz group, because a theory that respects symmetry under parity
</p>
<p>transformations must include the ( 12 , 0) and (0,
1
2 ) representations at
</p>
<p>the same time12. The objects transforming under this representation12 We showed in Section 3.7.9 that a
parity transformation transforms the
( 12 , 0) representation, into the (0,
</p>
<p>1
2 )
</p>
<p>representation.
</p>
<p>are called Dirac spinors and combine right-chiral and left-chiral Weyl
</p>
<p>spinors into one object13:

. (6.6)
</p>
<p>Now, we need to search for Lorentz invariant objects constructed
</p>
<p>from Dirac spinors, which we can then put into the Lagrangian. The
</p>
<p>first step is to search for invariants constructed from our left-chiral
</p>
<p>and right-chiral Weyl spinors.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>free theory 125
</p>
<p>We will use the Van-der-Waerden notation, which was introduced
</p>
<p>in Section 3.7.7. Two possibly invariants are14 14 There are two other possibilities,
which go by the name Majorana mass
terms. We already know how we can
move spinor indices up and down
by using the spinor "metric" ǫ. We
can write down a Lorentz invariant
term of the form ǫ(χL)
</p>
<p>&dagger;χL, because
ǫ(χL)
</p>
<p>&dagger; = χa has an upper-undotted
index. ǫ(χL)
</p>
<p>&dagger; transforms like a right-
chiral spinor, but by writing a term like
this we have less degrees of freedom.
ξR and χL both have two components,
and therefore we have four degrees of
freedom in a term like (ξR)
</p>
<p>&dagger;χL. In the
term ǫ(χL)
</p>
<p>&dagger;χL = χ
aχa, the object that
</p>
<p>transforms like a right-chiral spinor is
not independent of χL and we therefore
only have two degrees of freedom here.
There is a lot more one can say about
Majorana spinors and it is currently
under (experimental) investigation
which type of term is the correct one
for neutrinos. One more thing is worth
noting: a Majorana spinor is a "real"
Dirac spinor. I put real into quotation
marks, because usually real means
</p>
<p>Ψ⋆
!
= Ψ. For spinors this condition
</p>
<p>is not Lorentz invariant (because the
Lorentz transformations are complex
in this representation). If we impose
</p>
<p>the standard condition (Ψ⋆
!
= Ψ)
</p>
<p>in one frame, it will, in general, not
hold in another frame. Instead, it is
possible to derive a Lorentz invariant
"reality" condition for Dirac spinors:(
</p>
<p>0 ǫ
&minus;ǫ 0
</p>
<p>)
Ψ⋆
</p>
<p>!
= Ψ, which is commonly
</p>
<p>interpreted as charge conjugation. This
interpretation will be explained in
Section 7.1.5. Therefore, a Majorana
spinor describes a particle which is
equivalent to its charge conjugated
particle, commonly called anti-particle.
Majorana particles are their own anti-
particles and a Majorana spinor is a
Dirac spinor with an extra-condition:
</p>
<p>ΨM &equiv;
(
</p>
<p>χL
ǫχ⋆L
</p>
<p>)
or ΨM &equiv;
</p>
<p>(&minus;ǫξ⋆R

</p>
<p>I1 := χ

ȧ ξ
</p>
<p>ȧ = (χ⋆a)
Tξ ȧ = (χa)
</p>
<p>&dagger;ξ ȧ = (χL)
&dagger;ξR (6.7)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>I2 := (ξ
a)Tχa = ((ξ
</p>
<p>ȧ)⋆)Tχa = (ξR)
&dagger;χL, (6.8)
</p>
<p>because we always need to combine a lower dotted with an upper
</p>
<p>dotted and a lower undotted with an upper undotted index, in order
</p>
<p>to get a Lorentz invariant term. This was shown explicitly in Sec-
</p>
<p>tion 3.7.7. Here we see again that right-chiral and left-chiral spinors
</p>
<p>are needed in pairs.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can construct two Lorentz-invariant combinations
</p>
<p>involving first order derivatives, as we will see in a moment. But first
</p>
<p>we need to understand how we can write the derivative of a spinor.
</p>
<p>We learned in Section 3.7.8 how we can construct four-vectors from
</p>
<p>spinors
</p>
<p>vaḃ = vνσ
ν
aḃ
,
</p>
<p>where vν transforms like a four-vector. The differentiation operator is
</p>
<p>therefore in the spinor formalism
</p>
<p>&part;aḃ = &part;νσ
ν
aḃ
. (6.9)
</p>
<p>It is conventional to define σ̄0 = I2&times;2, σ̄i = &minus;σi and using this we can
construct the following Lorentz invariant terms
</p>
<p>I3 := (χȧ)
T&part;μ(σ
</p>
<p>μ)ȧbχb = (χL)
&dagger;&part;μσ̄
</p>
<p>μχL (6.10)

a)T&part;μ(σ
</p>
<p>μ)aḃξ
ḃ = (ξR)
</p>
<p>&dagger;&part;μσ
μξR . (6.11)
</p>
<p>In addition to (σμ)aḃ, we need here also (σ
μ)ȧb. The first index must
</p>
<p>be dotted and the second index undotted to combine properly with
</p>
<p>the other spinor indices. We get (σμ)ȧb by using the spinor metric
</p>
<p>twice:
</p>
<p>(σμ)ȧb = ((σμ)T)bȧ = ǫbc((σμ)T)cḋ(ǫ

<p>Don&rsquo;t let yourself get confused why &part;μ acts only on one spinor. We

<p>are going to use these invariants in Lagrangians, which we always

<p>evaluate inside of integrals15 and therefore, we can always integrate15 Remember that we get the equations

<p>by parts to get the other possibility. Therefore, our choice here is no

<p>restriction16.
16 We will see this more clearly when
we derive the corresponding equations

regardless of where we put &part;μ and we
could put both possibilities into the
Lagrangian. This would be longer, but
doesn&rsquo;t gives us anything new.

</p>
<p>Putting in the constants (A = &minus;m, B = i) gives us the final Dirac-
Lagrangian
</p>
<p>LDirac = &minus;mΨ̄Ψ + iΨ̄γμ&part;μΨ = Ψ̄(iγμ&part;μ &minus; m)Ψ. (6.16)
</p>
<p>Take note that what appears here in our Lagrangian are two distinct
</p>
<p>fields, because Ψ is complex21. This is a requirement, because other- 21 Therefore the left-chiral and right-
chiral spinors inside each Dirac spinor,
are complex, too.
</p>
<p>wise we can&rsquo;t get something Lorentz invariant. More explicitly, we
</p>
<p>have
</p>
<p>Ψ = Ψ1 + iΨ2
</p>
<p>with two real fields Ψ1 and Ψ2. Instead of working with two real
</p>
<p>fields it is conventional to work with two complex fields Ψ and Ψ̄, as
</p>
<p>two distinct fields.
</p>
<p>Now, if we put this Lagrangian into the Euler-Lagrange equation,

<p>which we recite here for convenience

</p>
<p>(
&part;L

</p>
<p>we get the equation of motion for Ψ
</p>
<p>(iγμ&part;
μ &minus; m)Ψ = 0 . (6.18)
</p>
<p>This is the famous Dirac equation, which is the equation of motion
</p>
<p>for spin 12 particles and fields. Take note that this is exactly what we
</p>
<p>get if we integrate the Lagrangian by parts
</p>
<p>&minus;mΨ̄Ψ + iΨ̄γμ&part;μΨ =︸︷︷︸
Integrate by parts. Just imagine here the action integral.
</p>
<p>&minus;mΨ̄Ψ &minus; (i&part;μΨ̄)γμΨ
</p>
<p>and then use the Euler-Lagrange equation,
</p>
<p>&rarr; &minus;mΨ + i&part;μγμΨ = 0 .
</p>
<p>So it really makes no difference and the way we wrote the Lagrangian
</p>
<p>is no restriction, despite its asymmetry22. 22 You are free to use the longer La-
grangian that includes both possibili-
ties, but the results are the same.

</p>
<p>Now, we want to find the equation of motion for an object transform-
</p>
<p>ing according to the ( 12 ,

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>128 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>already saw that this representation is the vector representation and
</p>
<p>therefore this task is easy. We simply take an arbitrary vector field
</p>
<p>Aμ and construct all possible Lorentz-invariants from it that are in
</p>
<p>agreement with the restrictions from Section 4.2. We must combine
</p>
<p>an upper with a lower index, because we defined the scalar product
</p>
<p>of Minkowski space in Section 2.4 this way and scalars are what we
</p>
<p>need in the Lagrangian. The possible invariants are2323 Again, a term of the form &part;μ&part;μAνAν
is redundant, because we can integrate
by parts and get &part;μAν&part;μAν.
</p>
<p>I1 = &part;
μAν&part;μAν , I2 = &part;
</p>
<p>μAν&part;νAμ
</p>
<p>I3 = A
μAμ , I4 = &part;
</p>
<p>μAμ
</p>
<p>and the Lagrangian reads
</p>
<p>LProka = C1&part;
μAν&part;μAν + C2&part;
</p>
<p>μAν&part;νAμ + C3A
μAμ + C4&part;
</p>
<p>μAμ. (6.19)
</p>
<p>We can neglect the term &part;μAμ, because has no influence on the equa-
</p>
<p>tions of motion, as can be seen by looking at the Euler-Lagrange
</p>
<p>equation24. Therefore order 1 in &part;μ is trivial.24 &part;σ

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>In this chapter we will derive how different fields and particles inter-
</p>
<p>act with each other. This will enable us, for example, to describe how
</p>
<p>electrons, interact with photons1. 1 From a different point of view: how
the electron field (= a massive spin 12
field) interacts with the photon field (=
a massless spin 1 field).
</p>
<p>We will be guided to the correct form of the Lagrangians by inter-
</p>
<p>nal symmetries, which are in this context often called gauge symme-
</p>
<p>tries2. The starting point will be local U(1) symmetry3 and we end up 2 This name will be explained in a
moment.
</p>
<p>3 This means we multiply the field at
each point in spacetime with a different
factor: eiα(x), instead of using the
same transformation everywhere: eiα.
In other words: the transformation
parameter α = α(x) is now a function of
x and has therefore a different value for
different points in spacetime.

.
</p>
<p>This is the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics. This Lagrangian
</p>
<p>describes the interaction between charged, massive spin 12 fields and
</p>
<p>a massless spin 1 field (the photon field). The Lagrangian is only then
</p>
<p>locally U(1) invariant, if we avoid "mass terms" of the form mAμAμ
</p>
<p>in the Lagrangian. This coincides with the experimental fact that
</p>
<p>photons, described by Aμ, are massless. Using Noether&rsquo;s theorem, we
</p>
<p>can derive a new conserved quantity from U(1) symmetry, which is
</p>

<p>which contains three spin 1 fields Wμ &equiv; (Wμ)i σ
i
</p>
<p>2 , with i = 1, 2, 3.
</p>
<p>We need three fields to make the Lagrangian locally SU(2) invariant,
</p>
<p>because we have three SU(2) basis generators: Ji =
σi
2 . We will
</p>
<p>see that local SU(2) symmetry can only be achieved without "mass
</p>
<p>terms" of the form mΨ̄Ψ, mWμWμ, with some arbitrary mass matrix
m, because Ψ is now a two-component object. So this time not only
</p>
<p>are the spin 1 fields (Wμ)i required to be massless, but the spin
1
2
</p>
<p>fields, too. Also allowed are equal masses for the two spin 12 fields,
</p>
<p>but from experiments we know that this is not the case: The electron
</p>
<p>mass is much bigger than the electron-neutrino mass. In addition,
</p>
<p>we know from experiments that the three spin 1 fields (Wμ)i are not
</p>
<p>massless. This is commonly interpreted as the SU(2) symmetry being
</p>
<p>broken.
</p>
<p>This idea is the starting point for the Higgs formalism, which is
</p>
<p>introduced afterwards. This formalism enables us to get a locally
</p>
<p>SU(2) invariant Lagrangian that includes mass terms. This works by
</p>
<p>adding the interaction with a spin 0 field, called Higgs field, into our
</p>
<p>considerations. The final locally SU(2)&times; U(1) invariant interaction
Lagrangian describes the so called electroweak interactions. The no-
</p>
<p>tion electroweak interactions contains the electromagnetic interaction
</p>
<p>and a new type of interaction called the weak interaction. Through
</p>
<p>the Higgs formalism the SU(2)&times; U(1) is broken to a remnant U(1)
symmetry. The weak interaction is mediated by three massive spin
</p>
<p>1 fields, called W+,W&minus; and Z and the remnant U(1) symmetry by
one massless spin 1 field γ. Using Noether&rsquo;s theorem we will be able
</p>
<p>to derive from SU(2) symmetry a new conserved quantity, called
</p>
<p>isospin, which is the charge of weak interactions analogous to elec-
</p>
<p>tric charge for electromagnetic interactions.
</p>
<p>Lastly, we will consider internal local SU(3) symmetry, which will
</p>
<p>lead us to a Lagrangian describing another new interaction, called the
</p>
<p>strong interaction. For this purpose, we will introduce triplet objects
</p>
<p>Q =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>q1
q2
q3
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ ,
</p>
<p>that are transformed by SU(3) transformations and which contain
</p>
<p>three spin 12 fields. These three spin
1
2 fields are interpreted as quarks
</p>
<p>carrying different color, which is the strong interaction analogue to
</p>
<p>the electrical charge of the electromagnetic interaction or isospin of
</p>
<p>the weak interaction. Again, mass terms are forbidden, but this time
</p>
<p>this coincides with the experimental fact that the 8 corresponding</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interaction theory 133
</p>
<p>bosons5, called gluons, are massless. In addition, we know from ex- 5 8 because SU(3) has 8 basis genera-
tors.periments that the fields inside a SU(3) triplet have the same mass,
</p>
<p>This is a good thing, because local SU(3) symmetry forbids a term
</p>
<p>with arbitrary mass matrix m for terms like mQ̄Q, but allows a term
</p>
<p>of the form Q̄
</p>
<p>(
m 0
</p>
<p>0 m
</p>
<p>)
Q, which means that the terms in the triplet
</p>
<p>have the same mass. Therefore local SU(3) invariance provides no
</p>
<p>new obstacles regarding mass terms in the Lagrangian and we there-
</p>
<p>fore say the SU(3) symmetry is unbroken. From experiments we
</p>
<p>know that only quarks (spin 12 ) and gluons (spin 1) carry color. The

<p>7.1 U(1) Interactions
</p>
<p>To derive the correct interaction terms in the Lagrangian, we are
</p>
<p>going to use internal symmetrie that are usually called gauge sym-
</p>
<p>metries. The notion gauge symmetry, is used for historic reasons and
</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make much sense for the type of symmetry we are consider-
</p>
<p>ing here. Weyl tried to derive electromagnetism6 6 Frank Wilczek. Riemann-einstein

<p>"as a consequence of spacetime symmetry, specifically symmetry under
</p>
<p>local changes of length scale."
</p>
<p>Naming this kind of symmetry gauge symmetry makes sense, be-
</p>
<p>cause this means, for example, that we can change the platinum bar
</p>
<p>that defines a standard meter (and which was used to gauge objects
</p>
<p>that measure length in experiments), arbitrarily without changing
</p>
<p>physics. This attempt was unsuccessful, but some time later, Weyl
</p>
<p>found the correct symmetry to derive electromagnetism and the
</p>
<p>name was kept.</p>

</p>
<p>7.1.1 Internal Symmetry of Free Spin 12 Fields
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look again at the Lagrangian that we derived for a free
</p>
<p>spin 12 theory (Eq. 6.16)
</p>
<p>LDirac = &minus;mΨ̄Ψ + iΨ̄γμ&part;μΨ = Ψ̄(iγμ&part;μ &minus; m)Ψ. (7.1)
</p>
<p>We derived it by demanding Lorentz symmetry, but if we take a
</p>
<p>sharp look we can discover another symmetry of this Lagrangian.
</p>
<p>The Lagrangian does not change if we transform the field Ψ as fol-
</p>
<p>lows
</p>
<p>Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime; = eiaΨ
</p>
<p>if we take into account that this implies that Ψ̄ also gets transformed
</p>
<p>&rArr; Ψ̄ &rarr; Ψ̄&prime; = Ψ&prime;&dagger;γ0 = (eiaΨ)&dagger;γ0 = Ψ̄e&minus;ia . (7.2)
</p>
<p>The minus sign comes from the complex conjugation7 and a is an7 Remember: Ψ̄ = Ψ&dagger;γ0.
</p>
<p>arbitrary real number. To see that the Lagrangian is invariant under
</p>
<p>this transformation, we transform the Lagrangian explicitly:
</p>
<p>L
&prime;
Dirac = &minus;mΨ̄&prime;Ψ&prime; + iΨ̄&prime;γμ&part;μΨ&prime;
</p>
<p>= &minus;m(Ψ̄e&minus;ia)(eiaΨ) + i(Ψ̄e&minus;ia)γμ&part;μ(eiaΨ)
= &minus;mΨ̄Ψ e&minus;iaeia︸ ︷︷ ︸
</p>
<p>=1
</p>
<p>+iΨ̄γμ&part;
μΨ e&minus;iaeia︸ ︷︷ ︸
</p>
<p>=1
</p>
<p>= &minus;mΨ̄Ψ + iΨ̄γμ&part;μΨ = LDirac, (7.3)
</p>
<p>where we used that eia is just a complex number, which we can move
</p>
<p>around freely8. Remembering that we learned in Chapter 3 that all8 Speaking more technically: A complex
number commutes with every matrix,
like, for example, γμ.
</p>
<p>unit complex numbers can be written as eia and form a group called
</p>
<p>U(1), we can put what we just discovered into mathematical terms,
</p>
<p>by saying that the Lagrangian is U(1) invariant. This symmetry is an
</p>
<p>internal symmetry, because it is clearly no spacetime transformation
</p>
<p>and therefore transforms the field internally. This internal symmetry
</p>
<p>does not look like a big thing. At a first glance it may seem like a
</p>
<p>nice, but rather useless, mathematical side note. However, quite sur-
</p>
<p>prisingly we will see in a moment that this observation is incredibly
</p>
<p>important!
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s have a deeper look at what we just discovered. We
</p>
<p>showed that we are free to multiply our field with an arbitrary unit
</p>
<p>complex number without changing anything. The symmetry transfor-
</p>
<p>mation Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime; = eiaΨ is called a global transformation, because we
multiply the field Ψ = Ψ(x) at every point x with the same factor eia.
</p>
<p>Now, why should this factor at one point in spacetime be cor-
</p>
<p>related to the factor at another point in spacetime? The choice at</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interaction theory 135
</p>
<p>one point in spacetime shouldn&rsquo;t fix this immediately in the whole
</p>
<p>universe. This would be strange, because special relativity tells us
</p>
<p>that no information can spread faster than light, as was shown in
</p>
<p>Section 2.4. For a global symmetry the choice would be fixed imme-
</p>
<p>diately for any point in the whole universe.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check if our Lagrangian is invariant if we transform each
</p>
<p>point in spacetime with a different factor a = a(x). This is called a
</p>
<p>local transformation.
</p>
<p>If we transform
</p>
<p>Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime; = eia(x)Ψ
&rArr;Ψ̄ &rarr; Ψ̄&prime; = e&minus;ia(x)Ψ̄, (7.4)
</p>
<p>where the factor a = a(x) now depends on the position, we get the
</p>
<p>transformed Lagrangian9 9 Maybe you wonder if the Lagrangian
that includes both possible derivatives,
which we neglected for brevity, is
locally U(1) invariant: L = &minus;mΨ̄Ψ +
iΨ̄γμ&part;
</p>
<p>μΨ + i(&part;μΨ̄)γμΨ. This Lagrangian
is indeed locally U(1) invariant, as
you can check, but take note that the
addition of the second and the third
term yields zero:
</p>
<p>iΨ̄γμ&part;
μΨ + i(&part;μΨ̄)γμΨ
</p>
<p>=︸︷︷︸
integration by parts
</p>
<p>i(&part;μΨ̄)γμΨ &minus; i(&part;μΨ̄)γμΨ = 0.
</p>
<p>The correct Lagrangian that includes
both possible derivatives has a minus
sign between those terms:LDirac =
&minus;mΨ̄Ψ + iΨ̄γμ&part;μΨ &minus; i(&part;μΨ̄)γμΨ and is
therefore not locally U(1) invariant.
</p>
<p>L
&prime;
Dirac = &minus;mΨ̄&prime;Ψ&prime; + iΨ̄&prime;γμ&part;μΨ&prime;
</p>

</p>
<p>= &minus;mΨ̄Ψ + iΨ̄γμ&part;μΨ + i2(&part;μa(x))Ψ̄γμΨ �= LDirac (7.5)
</p>
<p>Therefore, our Lagrangian is not invariant under local U(1) symme-
</p>
<p>try, because the product rule produces an extra term. As discussed
</p>
<p>above, our Lagrangian should be locally invariant, but we just found
</p>
<p>out that it isn&rsquo;t. There is something we can do about it, but first we
</p>
<p>must investigate another symmetry.
</p>
<p>7.1.2 Internal Symmetry of Free Spin 1 Fields
</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s take a look at the Lagrangian we derived for free spin 1
</p>
<p>particles10 10 See Eq. 6.26 and take note that we
neglect, for brevity, a conventional
factor 12 here.LProca = &part;
</p>
<p>μAν&part;μAν &minus; &part;μAν&part;νAμ + m2AμAμ. (7.6)
</p>
<p>We can discover a global internal symmetry here, too. If we trans-
</p>
<p>form
</p>
<p>Aμ &rarr; A&prime;μ = Aμ + aμ (7.7)
with some arbitrary constants aμ
</p>
<p>11, the Lagrangian reads12 11 Remember, as always, μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
</p>
<p>12 The aμ are constants and therefore
&part;μaν = 0 etc.L &prime;Proca = (&part;μA&prime;ν&part;μA&prime;ν &minus; &part;μA&prime;ν&part;νA&prime;μ) + m2A&prime;μA&prime;μ
</p>
<p>= &part;μ(Aν + aν)&part;μ(Aν + aν)&minus; &part;μ(Aν + aν)&part;ν(Aμ + aμ)) + m2(Aμ + aμ)(Aμ + aμ)
= &part;μAν&part;μAν &minus; &part;μAν&part;νAμ + m2(Aμ + aμ)(Aμ + aμ). (7.8)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>136 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>We conclude this transformation is a global symmetry transforma-
</p>
<p>tion of this Lagrangian, if we restrict ourselves to massless fields, i.e.
</p>
<p>m = 0.
</p>
<p>What about local symmetry here? We transform
</p>
<p>Aμ &rarr; A&prime;μ = Aμ + aμ(x) (7.9)
</p>
<p>and the transformed massless Lagrangian reads
</p>
<p>L
&prime;
Maxwell = (&part;
</p>
<p>μA&prime;ν&part;μA&prime;ν &minus; &part;μA&prime;ν&part;νA&prime;μ)
= &part;μ(Aν + aν(x))&part;μ(Aν + aν(x))&minus; &part;μ(Aν + aν(x))&part;ν(Aμ + aμ(x))
= &part;μAν&part;μAν + &part;
</p>
<p>μaν&part;μAν + &part;
μAν&part;μaν(x) + &part;
</p>
<p>μaν(x)&part;μaν(x)
</p>
<p>&minus; &part;μAν&part;νAμ &minus; &part;μAν&part;νaμ(x)&minus; &part;μaν(x)&part;νAμ &minus; &part;μaν(x)&part;νaμ(x) ,
(7.10)
</p>
<p>which shows that Aμ &rarr; A&prime;μ = Aμ + aμ(x) is not a local internal sym-
metry .
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can find a local internal symmetry by considering
</p>
<p>the transformation Aμ &rarr; A&prime;μ = Aμ + &part;μa(x) instead. This means
we add the derivative of some arbitrary function &part;μa(x) instead of an
</p>
<p>arbitrary function. This transformation has the following effect on the
</p>
<p>Lagrangian1313 The symmetry of partial deriva-
tives &part;ν&part;μ = &part;μ&part;ν is also known as
"Schwarz&rsquo;s theorem".
</p>
<p>&part;ν&part;μ=&part;μ&part;ν and renaming dummy indices
</p>
<p>We see this is indeed an internal local symmetry transformation.
</p>
<p>Again this may look like a technical side note. Okay, we found some
</p>
<p>internal, local symmetry; so what?
</p>
<p>7.1.3 Putting the Puzzle Pieces Together
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s summarize what we found out so far:
</p>
<p>&bull; We discovered the Lagrangian for free spin 12 fields has an internal
</p>
<p>global symmetry Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime; = eiaΨ. Formulated differently: the
Lagrangian for free spin 12 fields is invariant under global U(1)
</p>
<p>transformations.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interaction theory 137
</p>
<p>&bull; We saw that this symmetry is not local (although it should be),
</p>
<p>because for a = a(x), we get an extra term in the Lagrangian of the
</p>
<p>form (Eq. 7.5).
</p>
<p>&minus;(&part;μa(x))Ψ̄γμΨ. (7.12)
</p>
<p>In other words: The Lagrangian isn&rsquo;t locally U(1) invariant.
</p>
<p>&bull; In the last section we found an internal local symmetry for mass-
</p>
<p>less spin 1 fields
</p>
<p>Aμ &rarr; A&prime;μ = Aμ + &part;μa(x), (7.13)
</p>
<p>which is only a local symmetry if we add the derivative of an
</p>
<p>arbitrary function &part;μa(x), instead of an arbitrary function aμ(x).
</p>
<p>This really looks like two pieces of a puzzle we should put to-
</p>
<p>gether. When we transform Ψ, Ψ̄ and Aμ simultaneously, an addi-
</p>
<p>tional term AμΨ̄γ
μΨ in the Lagrangian becomes
</p>
<p>AμΨ̄γ
μΨ &rarr; (Aμ + &part;μa(x))Ψ̄γμΨ = AμΨ̄γμΨ + &part;μa(x)Ψ̄γμΨ . (7.14)
</p>
<p>Compare the second term here to Eq. 7.12. The new term in the La-
</p>
<p>grangian, coupling Ψ, Ψ̄ and Aμ together, therefore cancels exactly
</p>
<p>the term which stopped the Lagrangian for free spin 12 from being
</p>
<p>locally U(1) invariant. In other words: By adding this new term we
</p>
<p>can make the Lagrangian locally U(1) invariant.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s study this in more detail. First take note that it&rsquo;s conventional
</p>
<p>to factor out a constant g in the exponent of the local U(1) transfor-
</p>
<p>mation: eiga(x). Then the extra term becomes
</p>
<p>&minus;(&part;μa(x))Ψ̄γμΨ &rarr; &minus;g(&part;μa(x))Ψ̄γμΨ. (7.15)
</p>
<p>This extra factor g accounts for an arbitrary coupling constant14, as 14 A coupling constant always tells us
how strong a given interaction is. Here
we are talking about electromagnetic
interactions and g determines its
strength.
</p>
<p>we will see now. We then add to the Lagrangian for free spin 12 fields
</p>
<p>the new term
</p>
<p>gAμΨ̄γ
μΨ,
</p>
<p>where we included γμ to make the term Lorentz invariant15 and 15 Otherwise Aμ has an unmatched
index μ and therefore wouldn&rsquo;t be
Lorentz invariant.
</p>
<p>inserted the coupling constant16 g. This yields the Lagrangian
</p>
<p>16 We can see here that g determines
how strong Ψ, Ψ̄ and Aμ couple to-
gether.
</p>
<p>LDirac+Extra-Term = &minus;mΨ̄Ψ + iΨ̄γμ&part;μΨ + gAμΨ̄γμΨ.
</p>
<p>Transforming this Lagrangian according to the rules for local trans-

<p>formations of Ψ, Ψ̄ and Aμ yields
17
</p>
<p>17 The combined transformation of
Ψ, Ψ̄ and Aμ is called U(1) gauge

<p>The next question we have to answer is: What equations of motion

<p>7.1.4 Inhomogeneous Maxwell Equations and
</p>
<p>Minimal Coupling
</p>
<p>To spoil the surprise: This Lagrangian gives us the inhomogeneous
</p>
<p>Maxwell equations in the presence of currents.
</p>
<p>The process is again straightforward: we simply put the La-
</p>
<p>grangian (Eq. 7.17)

<p>&part;Ψ
&minus; &part;μ
</p>
<p>(
&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;(&part;μΨ)
</p>
<p>)

</p>
<p>&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;Ψ̄
&minus; &part;μ
</p>
<p>(

<p>&part;(&part;μΨ̄)

<p>)

&minus; &part;σ
</p>
<p>(
&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;(&part;σAρ)
</p>
<p>)
= 0.
</p>
<p>This yields
</p>
<p>Ψ̄(iγμ&part;
μ + m) + gAμΨ̄γ
</p>
<p>μ = 0 (7.20)
</p>
<p>(iγμ&part;
μ &minus; m)Ψ + gAμγμΨ = 0 (7.21)
</p>
<p>&part;ν(&part;
νAμ &minus; &part;μAν) + gΨ̄γμΨ = 0 . (7.22)
</p>
<p>The first two equations describe the behavior of spin 12 particles/fields
</p>
<p>in an external electromagnetic field. In many books the derivation of
</p>
<p>these equations uses the notion minimal coupling, by which is meant
</p>
<p>that in the presence of an external field the derivative &part;μ has to be
</p>
<p>changed into the covariant derivative
</p>
<p>&part;μ &rarr; Dμ = &part;μ &minus; igAμ (7.23)
</p>
<p>to yield the correct equations. The word "minimal" is used, because
</p>
<p>only one gauge field Aμ, with four components μ = 0, 1, 2, 3, is used.
</p>
<p>Now that we have the equation that describes how Dirac spinors
</p>
<p>behave in the presence of an external electromagnetic field (Eq. 7.21),
</p>
<p>we can show something that we promised in Section 3.7.10. There
</p>
<p>we claimed that a transformation, which we called very sugges-
</p>
<p>tively charge conjugation, changes the electric charge of the object
</p>
<p>it describes. In other words, if Ψ describes something of charge +e,
</p>
<p>the charge conjugate spinor ΨC describes something of charge &minus;e.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>140 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Electrical charge determines the coupling strength of spin 12 parti-
</p>
<p>cles/fields to an external spin 1 field and we therefore investigate
</p>
<p>now, which equation of motion holds for ΨC. Afterwards we will talk
</p>
<p>about the third equation, i.e. Eq. 7.22.
</p>
<p>7.1.5 Charge Conjugation, Again
</p>
<p>Before we can derive the corresponding equation, we need to find an
</p>
<p>explicit form of the charge conjugation operator for Dirac spinors. We
</p>
<p>derived in Section 3.7.10 the transformation (Eq. 3.244)
</p>
<p>Ψ =
</p>
<p>(
χL
ξR
</p>
<p>)
&rarr; ΨC =
</p>
<p>(
ξL
χR
</p>
<p>)
. (7.24)
</p>
<p>This transformation can now be described easily with the help of one
</p>
<p>of the γμ matrices. Using the definition of γ2 in Eq. 6.13, we have
</p>
<p>ΨC = iγ2Ψ
⋆ = i
</p>
<p>(
0 σ2
</p>
<p>&minus;σ2 0
</p>
<p>)(
χ⋆L
ξ⋆R
</p>
<p>)
, (7.25)
</p>
<p>because we can rewrite this, using that iσ2 = ǫ is exactly the spinor
</p>
<p>metric
</p>
<p>=
</p>
<p>(
0 ǫ
</p>
<p>&minus;ǫ 0
</p>
<p>)(
χ⋆L
ξ⋆R
</p>
<p>)
=
</p>
<p>(
ǫξ⋆R
&minus;ǫχ⋆L
</p>
<p>)
. (7.26)
</p>
<p>This is equivalent to
</p>
<p>=
</p>
<p>(
ξL
χR
</p>
<p>)
, (7.27)
</p>
<p>as was shown in Section 3.7.7, specifically Eq. 3.202. Therefore we
</p>
<p>start with Eq. 7.21:
</p>
<p>(iγμ&part;
μ &minus; m)Ψ + gAμγμΨ =
</p>
<p>(
γμ(i&part;
</p>
<p>μ + gAμ)&minus; m
)
Ψ = 0, (7.28)
</p>
<p>and complex conjugate this equation, as a first step towards an equa-
</p>
<p>tion for ΨC:
</p>
<p>&rarr;
(
γ⋆μ(&minus;i&part;μ + gAμ)&minus; m
</p>
<p>)
Ψ⋆ = 0. (7.29)
</p>
<p>Now, we multiply this equation from the left-hand side with γ2 and
</p>
<p>add a 1 = γ&minus;12 γ2 in front of Ψ
⋆:
</p>
<p>&rarr; γ2

</p>
<p>This is exactly the same equation of motion as for Ψ, but with op-

<p>posite coupling strength g &rarr; &minus;g. This justifies the name charge
conjugation19. 19 It is important to note that Ψc �=
</p>
<p>Ψ̄. Ψc = iγ2Ψ
⋆ and Ψ̄ = Ψ&dagger;γ0 =
</p>
<p>(Ψ⋆)Tγ0. Charge conjugation is the
correct transformation that enables
us to interpret things in terms of
antiparticles, as we will discuss later in
detail.
</p>
<p>Next, we turn to the third equation of motion derived in the last
</p>
<p>section (Eq. 7.22) which is called inhomogeneous Maxwell equation
</p>
<p>in the presence of an electric current. To make the notion "electric
</p>
<p>current" precise we need again Noether&rsquo;s theorem.
</p>
<p>7.1.6 Noether&rsquo;s Theorem for Internal U(1) Symmetry
</p>
<p>In Section 4.5.5 we learned that Noether&rsquo;s theorem connects each
</p>
<p>internal symmetry with a conserved quantity. What conserved quan-
</p>
<p>tity follows from the U(1) symmetry we just discovered? Noether&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>theorem for internal symmetries tells us that a transformation of the
</p>
<p>form
</p>
<p>Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime; = Ψ + δΨ
leads to a Noether current
</p>
<p>Jμ =
&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;(&part;μΨ)
δΨ
</p>
<p>which fulfils a continuity equation
</p>
<p>&part;μ J
μ = 0. (7.34)
</p>
<p>A global20 U(1) transformation is 20 Recall that the Lagrangian for free
spin 12 fields was only globally U(1)
invariant. The final Lagrangian of the
last section was locally U(1) invariant.
Global symmetry is a special case of
local symmetry with a =const. There-
fore, if we have a locally U(1) invariant
Lagrangian, it is automatically globally
U(1) invariant, too. Considering global
U(1) symmetry here will give us a
quantity that is conserved for free and
interacting fields.
</p>
<p>Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime; = eigaΨ = (1+ iga + . . .)Ψ.
We stop the series expansion of the exponential function, as usual,
</p>
<p>after the first term, because U(1) is a Lie group and arbitrary trans-
</p>
<p>formations can be built of infinitesimal ones. An infinitesimal trans-
</p>
<p>formation reads
</p>
<p>Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime; = Ψ + igaΨ.
Therefore we have δΨ = igaΨ and as we derived in Section 4.5.5 the
</p>
<p>corresponding Noether current is
</p>
<p>Jμ =
&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;(&part;μΨ)

<p>= &minus;Ψ̄γμgaΨ = &minus;gaΨ̄γμΨ. (7.35)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>142 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>We can ignore21 the arbitrary constant a, because the continuity equa-21 We keep the conventional constant
g, which is not arbitrary but has one
fixed value that is determined in
experiments.
</p>
<p>tion holds for arbitrary a and therefore, we define
</p>
<p>Jμ &equiv; &minus;gΨ̄γμΨ . (7.36)
</p>
<p>This is usually called the electric four-current. The zeroth component
</p>
<p>is the electric charge density, which gives us if we integrate it, a
</p>
<p>quantity that is conserved in time2222 This can be seen by following the
same steps as in Eq. 4.39.
</p>
<p>Q =
&int;
</p>
<p>d3x ρ︸︷︷︸
Charge density
</p>
<p>=
&int;
</p>
<p>d3xJ0 = &minus;g
&int;
</p>
<p>d3xΨ̄γ0Ψ. (7.37)
</p>
<p>In the quantum framework the objects Ψ will be related to probability
</p>
<p>amplitudes and this interpretation requires that
&int;
</p>
<p>d3xΨ̄γ0Ψ = 1,
</p>
<p>because the overall probability must be 100% = 1. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>conserved quantity is in fact the coupling strength g, which is for
</p>
<p>electromagnetism the electric charge. Therefore, global U(1) symme-
</p>
<p>try leads to the conservation of electric charge.
</p>
<p>If we now take a look again at Eq. 7.22, we can write it, using the
</p>
<p>definition in Eq. 7.36, as
</p>
<p>&part;ν(&part;
νAμ &minus; &part;μAν) + gΨ̄γμΨ︸ ︷︷ ︸
</p>
<p>=&minus;Jμ
= 0
</p>
<p>&rarr; &part;ν(&part;νAμ &minus; &part;μAν) = Jμ. (7.38)
Using the electromagnetic tensor as defined in Eq. 6.23 this equation
</p>
<p>reads
</p>
<p>&part;νF
νμ = Jμ. (7.39)
</p>
<p>These are the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations in the presence
</p>
<p>of an external electromagnetic current. These equations23, together23 Plural, because we have an equation
for each component μ. with the homogeneous Maxwell equations, which follow immediately
</p>
<p>from the definition of Fνμ, are the basis for the classical theory of
</p>
<p>electrodynamics24.24 We will see this explicitly in Chap-
ter 11.
</p>
<p>Next we take a quick look at interactions of massive spin 1 and
</p>
<p>spin 0 fields.
</p>
<p>7.1.7 Interaction of Massive Spin 0 Fields

<p>Take note that the Lagrangian we derived for spin 0 fields

</p>
<p>μΦ &minus; m2Φ2)

Nevertheless, the complex scalar theory

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interaction theory 143
</p>
<p>has U(1) symmetry, because then we have Φ &rarr; Φ&prime; = eiaΦ and
Φ⋆ &rarr; (Φ⋆)&prime; = e&minus;iaΦ⋆. Therefore it is possible to derive, analogous to
what we did in Section 7.1 for spin 12 fields, an interaction theory for
</p>
<p>this Lagrangian. The derivation is completely analogous25 and one 25 The correct Lagrangian can
be computed by substituting

&minus; &part;μ
</p>
<p>(
&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;(&part;μΦ⋆)
</p>
<p>)

</p>
<p>we find the corresponding equation of motion
</p>
<p>(&part;μ &minus; iqAμ)(&part;μ &minus; iqAμ)Φ &minus; m2Φ = 0, (7.42)
</p>
<p>which describes a charged spin 0 field coupled to a massless spin 1
</p>
<p>field.
</p>
<p>7.1.8 Interaction of Massive Spin 1 Fields
</p>
<p>The interaction of a massive spin 1 field with a massless spin 1 field
</p>
<p>is dictated by symmetry, too. The Lagrangian for massless spin 1
</p>
<p>fields is given by (Eq. 6.25)
</p>
<p>LMaxwell = &minus;
1
</p>
<p>4
FμνFμν.
</p>
<p>To distinguish between a massless and a massive spin 1 field, we
</p>
<p>name the massive field Bμ and define
</p>
<p>Gμν := &part;μBν &minus; &part;νBμ.
</p>
<p>The Lagrangian for this massive spin 1 field reads (Eq. 6.19)
</p>
<p>LProca = &minus;
1
</p>
<p>4
GμνGμν + m
</p>
<p>2BμBμ.
</p>
<p>Lorentz symmetry dictates the interaction term in the Lagrangian to
</p>
<p>be of the form
</p>
<p>LProca-interaction = CGμνF
μν,
</p>
<p>with a coupling constant C that we need to measure in experiments.
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested you can derive yourself the corresponding equa-
</p>
<p>tions of motion, by using the Euler-Lagrange equations.
</p>
<p>7.2 SU(2) Interactions
</p>
<p>Motivated by the success with U(1) symmetry we want to answer the
</p>
<p>question: Is U(1) the only internal symmetry of our Lagrangians?</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>144 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>It turns out that we can find an internal symmetry for two mass-
</p>
<p>less spin
1
</p>
<p>2 fields. We get the Lagrangian for two spin
1
</p>
<p>2 fields by
</p>
<p>adding two copies of the Lagrangian that we derived in Section 6.3.
</p>
<p>The final Lagrangian can be found in Eq. 6.16 and we recite it here
</p>
<p>for convenience:
</p>
<p>LDirac = ψ̄(iγμ&part;
μ &minus; m)ψ.
</p>
<p>Here we neglect mass terms, which means m = 0, because other-
</p>
<p>wise the Lagrangian isn&rsquo;t invariant as we will see in a moment. We
</p>
<p>will see later how we can include mass terms, without spoiling the
</p>
<p>symmetry. The addition yields
</p>
<p>LD1+D2 = iψ̄1γμ&part;
μψ1 + iψ̄2γμ&part;
</p>
<p>μψ2 . (7.43)
</p>
<p>This can be rewritten, if we define
</p>
<p>Ψ :=
</p>
<p>(
ψ1
ψ2
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>&rarr; Ψ̄ :=
(
ψ̄1 ψ̄2
</p>
<p>)
,
</p>
<p>where the newly defined object Ψ is called a doublet:
</p>
<p>LD1+D2 = iΨ̄γμ&part;
μΨ. (7.44)
</p>
<p>This Lagrangian is invariant under global SU(2) transformations2626 To calculate the transformation
behavior of Ψ̄, we use σ&dagger;i = σi , which
we already noted in Eq. 3.213.
</p>
<p>Ψ &rarr; Ψ&prime; = eiai
σi
2 Ψ (7.45)
</p>
<p>&rArr;Ψ̄ &rarr; Ψ̄&prime; = Ψ̄e&minus;iai

2 , (7.46)
</p>
<p>where a sum over the index "i" is implicitly assumed, ai denotes
</p>
<p>arbitrary real constants and σi2 are the usual generators of SU(2),
</p>
<p>with the Pauli matrices σi.
</p>
<p>To see the invariance we take a look at the transformed Lagrangian27
</p>
<p>27 We neglect mass terms here, because
they are, in general, not invariant under
SU(2) transformations. The mass terms
would be &minus;m1Ψ̄1Ψ1 and &minus;m2Ψ̄2Ψ2
and we could write them, using the
two component definition for Ψ and by
defining
</p>
<p>m :=
</p>
<p>(
m1 0
0 m2
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>as
LD1+D2 = &minus;Ψ̄mΨ.
</p>
<p>Such a term is not invariant under
SU(2) transformations, because, in
general,
</p>
<p>LD1+D2 = &minus;Ψ̄&prime;mΨ&prime; = Ψ̄ e&minus;iai
σi
2 meiai
</p>
<p>σi
2︸ ︷︷ ︸
</p>
<p>�=m
Ψ.
</p>
<p>For equal masses m1 = m2 it would
be invariant, but we are going to see
how we can include arbitrary mass
terms without violating this symmetry.
We know from experiments that the
two fields in the doublet do not create
particles of equal mass, i.e. m1 �= m2.
This will be discussed later in detail.

</p>
<p>This symmetry should be a local symmetry, too. The SU(2) trans-
</p>
<p>formations mix the two components of the doublet. Later we will
</p>
<p>give these two fields names like electron and electron-neutrino field.
</p>
<p>Our symmetry here tells us that it does not matter what we call
</p>
<p>electron and what electron-neutrino field, because by using SU(2)
</p>
<p>transformations we can mix them as we like. If this is only a global
</p>
<p>symmetry, as soon as we fix one choice28, which means we decide 28 This is known as choosing a gauge.
</p>
<p>what we call electron and what electron-neutrino field, this choice
</p>
<p>would be fixed immediately for the complete universe. Therefore we
</p>
<p>investigate if this is a local symmetry. Again we find that it isn&rsquo;t, but
</p>
<p>as for local U(1) symmetry, we will do everything we can to make
</p>
<p>the Lagrangian locally SU(2) invariant.
</p>

</p>
<p>We can see that the Lagrangian is not invariant because we get an
</p>
<p>additional term, iΨ̄γμU
&dagger;(x)(&part;μU(x))Ψ, after the transformation.
</p>
<p>So how can we modify our Lagrangian LD1+D2 such that is in-
</p>
<p>variant under local SU(2) transformations? In principle the same
</p>
<p>method that we discovered in the last sections to ensure local U(1)
</p>
<p>works again. However, some details are a bit more complicated. We
</p>
<p>already noted in Eq. 7.23 that the essence of how we need to change
</p>
<p>our Lagrangian can be summarized through the replacement of the
</p>
<p>ordinary derivative &part;μ, with a "covariant derivative" Dμ = &part;μ &minus; igAμ.
With this in mind, we replace the derivative &part;μ in our Lagrangian
</p>
<p>LD1+D2 with a new object D
μ and then try to derive how Dμ looks
</p>
<p>like in order to ensure local SU(2) invariance.
</p>
<p>Concretely, we now write
</p>
<p>L̃D1+D2 = iΨ̄γμD
μΨ (7.51)

<p>and under a local SU(2) transformation this Lagrangian becomes</p>

<p>because then2929 The reason that we can change the
positions of U&dagger;(x) and γμ, as already
discussed in the text below Eq. 7.47,
is that γμ is a matrix that acts on the
components of the Dirac spinors,
whereas the SU(2) transformation
mixes the two Dirac spinors ψ1 and ψ2
inside the doublet Ψ.

</p>
<p>So our goal is to find an object Dμ that has exactly this transforma-
</p>
<p>tion behavior (DμΨ)&prime; = U(x)DμΨ. Take note that this property is
the reason why we call Dμ the "covariant derivative"30. The covariant30 The notion "covariance" was dis-
</p>
<p>cussed in Section 2.6 and means
roughly that the form of an equa-
tion or an object is not changed under a
given transformation.
</p>
<p>derivative of Ψ, which we denote by DμΨ, transforms exactly like
</p>
<p>Ψ, i.e. Ψ&prime; = U(x)Ψ. Thus the form stays the same and we don&rsquo;t get
additional terms, like we do if we use the ordinary derivative &part;μ31.
</p>
<p>31 This was demonstrated in Eq. 7.50. From our experience with local U(1) symmetry, we already know
</p>
<p>that the crucial trick is to make use of spin 1 fields. However, there
</p>
<p>is one crucial difference. We saw in Eq. 7.50 that again the reason
</p>
<p>for the non-invariance is that the derivative &part;μ produces an ex-
</p>
<p>tra term iΨ̄γμU
&dagger;(x)(&part;μU(x))Ψ. Our local SU(2) transformations
</p>
<p>U(x) &equiv; e&minus;iai(x)
σi
2 are a bit more complicated than local U(1) trans-
</p>
<p>formations U(x) &equiv; e&minus;iα(x), because of the generators σi/2 in the
exponent. For local SU(2) transformations, we have
</p>
<p>&part;μU(x) = &part;μe
&minus;iai(x)
</p>
<p>σi
2 = &minus;i(&part;μai(x))
</p>
<p>σi

e&minus;iai(x)

</p>
<p>We can see here that we actually get three extra terms32, one for32 We have here an implicit sum, in
the sense of Einstein&rsquo;s summation
convention, over the index i.
</p>
<p>each Pauli matrix σi. Thus in contrast to the U(1) case, to make the
</p>
<p>Lagrangian locally SU(2) invariant we don&rsquo;t need one additional spin
</p>
<p>1 field, but three! In addition, we can see that the troublesome terms,
</p>
<p>that are produced through the derivative in the Lagrangian &part;μ, are
</p>
<p>proportional to the generators σi2 .
</p>
<p>To summarize: we need three spin 1 fields to cancel the terms that
</p>
<p>make our Lagrangian non-invariant under local SU(2) transforma-
</p>
<p>tions and must introduce these new fields in such a way that they are
</p>
<p>able to cancel terms that involve the generators σi2 .</p>

is not invariant under such transformations33.33 This can be seen by using the ex-
</p>
<p>plicit transformation behavior that we
derived in Eq. 7.58. We saw above that the demand for local U(1) symmetry was pow-
</p>
<p>erful and yielded the correct Lagrangian that describes electromag-
</p>
<p>netic interactions. Thus instead of discarding the transformation
</p>
<p>behavior that successfully makes the spin 12 part of of the Lagrangian
</p>
<p>invariant under local SU(2) transformations, because it is not a sym-
</p>
<p>metry of the free spin 1 field Lagrangian, we try to find a better La-
</p>
<p>grangian for these spin 1 fields which has the desired symmetry. In
</p>
<p>other words, our final task is to derive a Lagrangian that describes
</p>
<p>how these new spin 1 fields behave when they are on their own that
</p>
<p>is invariant under the transformation in Eq. 7.58.
</p>
<p>To find this Lagrangian, we need to note several things:
</p>
<p>1. The new spin 1 fields (Wμ)i always appeared in the previous
</p>
<p>Lagrangians34 in combination with the generators σ
i
</p>
<p>2 . It is thus
34 See, e.g. Eq. 7.58.
</p>
<p>useful to introduce a new object Wμ &equiv; (Wμ)i σ
i
</p>
<p>2 . Next, we might
</p>
<p>try to use this new object Wμ instead of (Wμ)i in the Lagrangian
Eq. 7.5935. The important difference is that Wμ is a matrix, because35 It will become clear in a moment,
</p>
<p>why this is useful, although at a first
glance it seems to make things much
more complicated.
</p>
<p>the generators are matrices. Therefore, when we define our field
</p>
<p>strength tensor in terms of the new object Wμ:
</p>
<p>Wμν = &part;μWν &minus; &part;νWμ , (7.60)
</p>
<p>it becomes a matrix, too.
</p>
<p>2. We want a Lagrangian that is invariant under local SU(2) trans-
</p>
<p>formations, and therefore need to combine our fields in such a way
</p>
<p>that their transformation behavior cancels exactly. Now that we
</p>
<p>have new objects (Wμ,Wμν) that are matrices, we can try to make
use of the following nice property of the trace of matrices3636 This property is known as "cyclic
</p>
<p>property" of the trace. In words it
means that the trace stays the same
when we perform cyclic permutations
among the matrices A, B,C, D that
appear here. We always take the last
element that appears in the product and
put it at the beginning. However, take
note that arbitrary permutations do not
lead to the same trace. For example,
Tr(ACBD) �= Tr(ABCD).
</p>
<p>Tr(ABCD) = Tr(DABC) = Tr(CDAB) = Tr(BCDA) . (7.61)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interaction theory 149
</p>
<p>If we somehow manage that our field strength tensor transforms
</p>
<p>as Wμν &rarr; U(x)WμνU&minus;1(x), the term Tr(WμνWμν) would be
invariant, because37 37 To get to the second line, we use the

<p>3. Unfortunately, the naive field strength tensor that we wrote
</p>
<p>down in Eq. 7.60 does not transform so nicely. However, we
</p>
<p>can construct a different field strength tensor that has exactly
</p>
<p>the needed transformation behavior. Above, we derived the co-
</p>
<p>variant derivative Dμ that transforms exactly in the way we
</p>
<p>need it to get a locally SU(2) invariant Lagrangian for the spin
1
2 fields: (D
</p>

as38 Ψ &rarr; U(x)Ψ. Therefore, we can conclude that the covariant 38 See Eq. 7.48.

</p>
<p>Now the final crucial trick to get a locally SU(2) invariant La-
</p>
<p>grangian for the spin 1 fields is the observation that the object39
</p>
<p>39 At this point the way we introduce
this correct field strength tensor may
seem a bit like magic. However, of
course, there is a deep reason why the
correct field strength tensor must be the
commutator of the covariant derivative.
Unfortunately, a proper discussion lies
beyond the scope of this text. It will
become clear in the a moment, why we
included the additional factor ig here.

short: we need to include all terms that
are allowed by our restrictions in the
Lagrangian. For the spin 1 fields this
means that we not only need &part;μWν
but also &part;νWμ. To correctly account for
both these possibilities, we need to use
not only DμDν, but also DνDμ. This
will be made explicit below.

<p>The last term here is what we missed previously42. It is important42 In addition, we can see here, why we
included the factor ig in the definition

<p>of Wμν. this factor is exactly what we
need to cancel the factors that come
from the definition of Dμ.
</p>
<p>for local SU(2) symmetry, because the Wμ are now matrices and
therefore WμWν �= WνWμ. In contrast, in order to ensure local
U(1) symmetry there was no need for such a term. There was
</p>
<p>just one spin 1 field, hence no matrix and therefore this last term
</p>
<p>vanishes.

</p>
<p>neously breaks at lower energies.
</p>
<p>So far we derived a locally U(1) invariant Lagrangian and in this

<p>context it&rsquo;s conventional to name the corresponding spin 1 field Bμ:

<p>As above, the three spin 1 fields (Wν)i are called the SU(2) gauge

<p>fields, because they make the Lagrangian locally SU(2) invariant.

<p>Now, how can we add mass terms to this Lagrangian without
</p>
<p>spoiling the SU(2) symmetry? The only ingredient we haven&rsquo;t used
</p>
<p>so far is a spin 0 field; so let&rsquo;s see. The globally U(1) invariant La-
</p>
<p>grangian for a complex spin 0 field is given by (Eq. 7.40)

. (7.72)
</p>
<p>We can add to this Lagrangian the next higher power in φ without
</p>
<p>violating any symmetry constraints45. Thus we write, renaming the 45 Recall that only higher order deriva-
tives were really forbidden in order to
get a sensible theory. Higher powers
of φ describe the self-interaction of the
field φ and were omitted in order to get
a "free" theory.

<p>Lspin0+extraTerm = &part;μφ
&dagger;&part;μφ+ ρ2φ&dagger;φ&minus; λ(φ&dagger;φ)2. (7.73)
</p>
<p>We already know from Eq. 7.41 how we can add a coupling term
</p>
<p>between this spin 0 field and a U(1) gauge field Bμ, which makes the
</p>
<p>Lagrangian locally U(1) invariant:
</p>
<p>Lspin0+extraTerm+spin1Coupling =
(
(&part;μ + igBμ)φ

<p>&dagger;

</p>
<p>(&part;μ &minus; igBμ)φ

</p>
<p>+ ρ2φ&dagger;φ&minus; λ(φ&dagger;φ)2 (7.74)

<p>with the symmetries46 46 See Eq. 7.13 and recall that an overall
constant in the Lagrangian has no
influence.</p>

<p>in the following how this Lagrangian gives us mass terms for the

<p>μ. Adding mass terms "by hand" to the

<p>Lagrangian does not work, because these terms spoil the symmetry
</p>
<p>and this leads to an insensible theory49.49 The reason is quite complicated and
will not be discussed in this book. In
technical terms: We need a locally
SU(2) symmetric Lagrangian to get
a renormalizable theory. You are
encouraged to read about this in the
books mentioned at the end of this

<p>is often called Higgs potential. A two-dimensional plot for different
</p>
<p>values of ρ, with λ &gt; 0 can be seen in Fig. 7.1.
</p>
<p>The idea is that at very high temperatures, e.g. in the early uni-
</p>
<p>verse, the potential looks like in the image to the left. The minimum,
</p>
<p>in this context called the vacuum expectation value, is without am-
</p>
<p>biguity at φ = 0. With sinking temperature the parameters λ and ρ
</p>
<p>change, and with them the shape of the potential. After the temper-
</p>
<p>ature dropped below some critical value the potential no longer has
</p>
<p>its minimum at φ = 0, as indicated in the pictures to the right. Now
</p>
<p>there is not only one location with the minimum value, but many.

<p>Writing the complex spin 0 doublet in this form is useful, because
</p>
<p>we can now use the local SU(2) (gauge) symmetry to make com-
</p>
<p>putations simpler. In order to get physical results one gauge must
</p>
<p>be chosen and we prefer to work with a gauge that makes life the
</p>
<p>easiest52.52 For different computations, different
gauges can be useful. Here we will
work with what is called the unitary
gauge, that is particularly useful to
understand the physical particle content
of a theory.
</p>
<p>A general local SU(2) transformation is
</p>
<p>Φ &rarr; Φ&prime; = eibi(x)
σi
2 Φ, (7.92)
</p>
<p>which enables us to eliminate the exponential factor in Eq. 7.90, by
</p>
<p>choosing appropriate bi(x). The complex scalar doublet is then, in
</p>
<p>this unitary gauge
</p>
<p>Φun =
</p>
<p>(
0
</p>
<p>v+h&radic;
2
</p>
<p>)
. (7.93)
</p>
<p>Another possible way to understand this is that of the original four
</p>
<p>components that appeared in our complex scalar doublet, three are
</p>
<p>equivalent to our SU(2) gauge freedom53. Therefore, these three
</p>
<p>53 Take note that this is only possible,
because we have a local SU(2) theory,
because our fields θ = θ(x), of course
depend on the location in spacetime.
For a global symmetry, these compo-
nents can&rsquo;t be gauged away, and are
commonly interpreted as massless
bosons, called Goldstone bosons.
</p>
<p>fields aren&rsquo;t physical54 and can&rsquo;t be measured in experiments. What
</p>
<p>54 The local SU(2) symmetry is nothing
that can be measured in experiments.
This is merely a symmetry of our equa-
tions and the gauge freedom disappears
from everything that is measurable in
experiments. Otherwise there would
be no possible way to make predictions
from our theory, because we would
have an infinite number of equivalently
possible predictions (that are connected
by SU(2) transformations). Neverthe-
less, this symmetry is far from being
useless, because it guides us to the
correct form of the Lagrangian.
</p>
<p>remains is one physical field h, which is called the Higgs field.
</p>
<p>Next, we want to take a look at the implications of this symmetry
</p>
<p>breaking on the Lagrangian. We recite here the Lagrangian in ques-
</p>
<p>tion for convenience, which was derived in Eq. 7.74 and include an
</p>
<p>additional factor 12 in front of the field Bμ to unclutter the notation in
</p>
<p>the calculations that follow5555 Such a factor changes nothing, be-
cause it corresponds simply to a redefi-
nition of the coupling constant 12 g̃ &equiv; g.
Thus, strictly speaking, we should use
g̃ here instead of g. However, the name
of the constant doesn&rsquo;t matter and we
continue to call the coupling constant
simply g.</p>

<p>parity violation.</p>

</p>
<p>7.4 Parity Violation
</p>
<p>One of the biggest discoveries in the history of science was that na-
</p>
<p>ture is not invariant under parity transformations. In layman&rsquo;s terms
</p>
<p>this means that some experiments behave differently than their mir-
</p>
<p>rored analogue. The experiment that discovered the violation of
</p>
<p>parity symmetry was the Wu experiment. A full description of this
</p>
<p>experiment, although fascinating, strays from our current subject, so
</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just discuss the final result.
</p>
<p>The Wu experiment discovered that the particles mediating the
</p>
<p>weak force (the W+,W&minus;, Z bosons) only couple to left-chiral parti-
cles. In other words: only left-chiral particles interact via the weak
</p>
<p>force61. All particles produced in weak interactions are left-chiral.61 We will discuss at the end of this
section why this means that parity is
violated
</p>
<p>Neutrinos interact exclusively via the weak force and therefore it is
</p>
<p>possible that there are no right-chiral neutrinos62. All other particles
62 We will see in a moment that massive,
left-chiral particles always get a right-
chiral component during propagation.
It is known from experiments that
neutrinos have mass and therefore we
would expect a right-chiral neutrino
component. Nevertheless, this right-
chiral component does not participate
in any known interaction.
</p>
<p>can be produced via other interactions and therefore can be right-
</p>
<p>chiral, too.
</p>
<p>Up to this point, we used left-chiral and right-chiral as labels for
</p>
<p>objects transforming according to different representations of the
</p>
<p>Lorentz group. Although this seems like something very abstract, we
</p>
<p>can measure the chirality of particles, because there is a correlation to
</p>
<p>a more intuitive concept called helicity63.
</p>
<p>63 We will not discuss this here, because
the details make no difference for the
purpose of the text. The message to
take away is that it can be done. A very
nice discussion of these matters can
be found in Alessandro Bettini. Intro-
duction to Elementary Particle Physics.
Cambridge University Press, 2nd edi-
tion, 4 2014. ISBN 9781107050402
</p>
<p>In fact, most of the time particles do not have a specified chirality,
</p>
<p>which means they aren&rsquo;t definitely left-chiral or right-chiral and the
</p>
<p>corresponding Dirac spinor Ψ has both components. Parity viola-
</p>
<p>tion was no prediction of the theory and a total surprise for every
</p>
<p>physicist. Until the present day, no one knows why nature behaves so
</p>
<p>strangely. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s easy to accommodate this discovery into
</p>
<p>our framework. We only need something that makes sure we always
</p>
<p>deal with left-chiral spinors when we describe weak interactions.
</p>
<p>Recall that the symbols χ and ξ denote Weyl spinors (two compo-
</p>
<p>nent objects), ψ Dirac spinors (four component objects, consisting of
</p>
<p>two Weyl spinors)
</p>
<p>ψ =
</p>
<p>(
χL
ξR
</p>
<p>)
(7.109)
</p>
<p>and Ψ doublets of Dirac spinors
</p>
<p>Ψ =
</p>
<p>(
ψ1
ψ2
</p>
<p>)
. (7.110)
</p>
<p>Then the "something" we need is the projection operator PL:
</p>
<p>PLψ = PL
</p>
<p>(
χL
ξR
</p>
<p>)
=
</p>
<p>(
χL
0
</p>
<p>)
&equiv; ψL. (7.111)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interaction theory 159
</p>
<p>Such a projection operator can be constructed using the matrix64 64 Recall the definition of the γμ matri-
ces in Eq. 6.13 and don&rsquo;t let yourself get
confused about the missing γ4 matrix.
There is an alternative convention that
uses γ4 instead of γ0 and to avoid inter-
ference between those conventions, the
matrix here is commonly called γ5.
</p>
<p>γ5 = iγ0γ1γ2γ3 =
</p>
<p>(
&minus;1 0
0 1
</p>
<p>)
. (7.112)
</p>
<p>The matrix γ5 is called the chirality operator, because states of pure
</p>
<p>chirality
</p>
<p>(
χL
0
</p>
<p>)
or
</p>
<p>(
0
</p>
<p>ξR
</p>
<p>)
are eigenstates of γ5 with eigenvalue &minus;1
</p>
<p>and +1 respectively.
</p>
<p>The projection operator PL can then be written
65 65 Maybe you wonder why we define PL
</p>
<p>as so complicated and do not start with
the explicit matrix form right away. We
do this, because it&rsquo;s possible to work
in a different basis where the matrices
γμ look completely different. (For more
information about this have a look
at Section 8.10). Take note that in the
Lagrangian the Dirac spinors appear al-
ways in combination with the matrices
γμ. We can always add a 1 = U&minus;1U,
with some arbitrary invertible ma-
trix U, between them. For example,
&part;μΨ̄γμΨ = &part;μΨ̄ U

<p>. Physics is of

<p>course completely independent of such
transformations, but we can use this to
simplify computations. The basis we
prefer to work with in this text is called
Weyl Basis. In other bases the two com-
ponents of a Dirac spinor are mixtures
of χL and ξR. Nevertheless, the projec-

</p>
<p>Now, in order to accommodate for the fact that only left-chiral
</p>
<p>particles interact via the weak force, we must simply include PL into
</p>
<p>all terms of the Lagrangian that describe the interaction of W&plusmn;μ and
Zμ with different fields. The corresponding terms were derived in
</p>
<p>Section 7.2, and the final result was Eq. 7.67, which we recite here for
</p>
<p>convenience:

Tr
(
WμνWμν
</p>
<p>)
. (7.115)
</p>
<p>The relevant term that describes the interaction is gΨ̄γμWμΨ and we
simply add PL:
</p>
<p>&rarr; L = iΨ̄γμ(&part;μ &minus; igWμPL)Ψ &minus;
1
</p>
<p>4
Tr
(
WμνWμν
</p>
<p>)
. (7.116)
</p>
<p>Here PL acts on a doublet and is therefore
</p>
<p>PLΨ =

<p>(

</p>
<p>)
. (7.117)
</p>
<p>One PL is enough to project the left-chiral component out of both
</p>
<p>doublets Ψ̄ and Ψ. To see this we need three identities:
</p>
<p>&bull; (PL)
2 = PL, which is obvious from the explicit matrix form and
</p>
<p>because every projection operator must have this property66. Pro- 66 Another defining condition of any
projection operator is PLPR = PRPL = 0,
which is here fulfilled as you can check
by using the explicit form of PL,PR and
γ5.
</p>
<p>jecting twice must be the same as projecting one time.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>160 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>&bull; {γ5,γμ} = γ5γμ + γμγ5 = 0, which you can check by brute force
computation67.
</p>
<p>67 Or using another identity {γμ,γν} =
γμγν + γνγμ =
</p>
<p>1
2 ημν, where ημν is the
</p>
<p>Minkowski metric and the definition
γ5 = iγ0γ1γ2γ3.
</p>
<p>&bull; (PL)
&dagger; = PL, because γ5 is real, as can be seen from the explicit
</p>
<p>matrix form: γ5 =
</p>
<p>(
&minus;1 0
0 1
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>The second identity simply tells us that γ5γμ = &minus;γμγ5, i.e. that
we can switch the position of γ5 and any γμ matrix, as long as we
</p>
<p>include a minus sign. This tells us
</p>
<p>γμPL = γμ
1&minus; γ5
</p>
<p>2
=
</p>
<p>1+ γ5
2
</p>
<p>γμ = PRγμ. (7.118)

<p>We can now rewrite the relevant term of Eq. 7.116:

</p>
<p>We can see here that one projection operator is really enough to
</p>
<p>guarantee that both Ψ and Ψ̄ are left-chiral.
</p>
<p>Now we know how we can describe mathematically that only left-
</p>
<p>chiral fields interact via the weak force, but why does this mean that
</p>
<p>parity is violated? To understand this we need to parity transform
</p>
<p>this term, because if it isn&rsquo;t invariant, the physical system in question
</p>
<p>is different from its mirror image68. Here we need the parity operator
</p>
<p>68 This means an experiment, whose
outcome depends on this term of
the Lagrangian, will find a different
outcome if everything in the experiment
is arranged mirrored.
</p>
<p>for spinors69 Pspinor and vectors
70 Pvector. The transformation yields69 The parity operator for spinors was
</p>
<p>derived in Section 3.7.9. Using the
γμ matrices, we can write the parity
operator derived there as P = γ0 =(
0 σ0

</p>
<p>)
=
</p>
<p>(

</p>

</p>
<p>70 The parity operator for vectors is
</p>
<p>simply Pvector =

<p>interaction theory 161
</p>
<p>Then we can use γ0γ0γ0 = γ0 and γ0γiγ0 = &minus;γi, as you can check
by looking at the explicit form of the matrices. Furthermore, we have
</p>
<p>PvectorW
0 = W0 and PvectorWi = &minus;Wi, which follows from the explicit
</p>
<p>form of Pvector. We conclude these two minus signs cancel each other
</p>
<p>and the parity transformed term of the Lagrangian reads:

&dagger;γ0γμ(PvectorWμ)PL(PspinorΨ) = Ψ̄γμWμPRΨ �= Ψ̄γμWμPLΨ
</p>
<p>(7.121)
</p>
<p>Therefore this term is not invariant and parity is violated.
</p>
<p>Parity violation has another important implication. Recall that
</p>
<p>we always write things below each other between two big brackets
</p>
<p>if they can transform into each other71. For example, we use four- 71 This is explained in Appendix A.
</p>
<p>vectors, because their components can transform into each other
</p>
<p>through rotations or boosts. In this section we learned that only left-
</p>
<p>chiral particles interact via the weak force and the correct term in the
</p>
<p>Lagrangian is Ψ̄γμWμPLΨ = Ψ̄LγμWμΨL. In physical terms this
term means that the components of the left-chiral doublets, which
</p>
<p>means the two spin 12 fields (ψ1)L and (ψ2)L can transform into each
</p>
<p>other through weak-interactions. Right-chiral fields do not interact
</p>
<p>via the weak force and therefore (ψ1)R, (ψ2)R aren&rsquo;t transformed into
</p>
<p>each other. Therefore writing them below each other between two
</p>
<p>big brackets makes no sense. In mathematical terms this means that

<p>right-chiral fields form SU(2) singlets, i.e. are objects transforming
</p>
<p>according to the 1 dimensional representation of SU(2), which do not
</p>
<p>change at all72. So let&rsquo;s summarize: 72 This was explained in Section 3.6.2.
</p>
<p>&bull; Left-chiral fields are written as SU(2) doublets: ΨL =
</p>
<p>(
(ψ1)L
(ψ2)L
</p>
<p>)
,
</p>
<p>because they interact via the weak force and therefore can trans-
</p>
<p>form into each other. They transform under the two-dimensional
</p>
<p>representation of SU(2):
</p>
<p>ΨL &rarr; Ψ&prime;L = ei�a
�σ
2 ΨL . (7.122)
</p>
<p>&bull; Right-chiral fields are described by SU(2) singlets: (ψ1)R, (ψ2)R,
</p>
<p>because they do not interact via the weak force and therefore can&rsquo;t
</p>
<p>transform into each other. Therefore they transform under the
</p>
<p>one-dimensional representation of SU(2):
</p>
<p>(ψ1)R &rarr; (ψ1)&prime;R = e0(ψ1)R = (ψ1)R
(ψ2)R &rarr; (ψ2)&prime;R = e0(ψ2)R = (ψ2)R . (7.123)

<p>7.5 Lepton Mass Terms
</p>
<p>At the beginning of Section 7.2, we discovered that we can&rsquo;t include
</p>
<p>arbitrary mass terms Ψ̄mΨ without spoiling the SU(2) symmetry.
</p>
<p>Now we will see that parity violation makes this problem even big-
</p>
<p>ger. After discussing the problem, we will see that again the Higgs
</p>
<p>mechanism is a solution.
</p>
<p>In the last section we talked a bit about the chirality of the cou-
</p>
<p>pling term: Ψ̄γμσjW
μ
j PLΨ. What about the chirality of a mass term?
</p>
<p>Take a look again at the invariants without derivatives for spinors,
</p>
<p>which we derived in Eq. 6.7 and Eq. 6.8:
</p>
<p>I1 := (χȧ)
Tξ ȧ = (χL)
</p>
<p>&dagger;ξR and I2 := (ξ
a)Tχa = (ξR)
</p>
<p>&dagger;χL (7.124)
</p>
<p>We can write these invariants using Dirac spinors as7373 The Dirac spinors ψL and ψR are
defined using the chiral-projection
operators introduced in the last section:
ψL = PLψ and ψR = PRψ. And we have
as always ψ̄ = ψ&dagger;γ0.

</p>
<p>We can see that Lorentz invariant mass terms always combine left-
</p>
<p>chiral with right-chiral fields. This is a problem, because left-chiral
</p>
<p>and right-chiral fields transform differently under SU(2) transfor-
</p>
<p>mations, as explained at the end of the last section. The left-chiral
</p>
<p>fields are doublets, whereas the right-chiral fields are singlets. The
</p>
<p>multiplication of a doublet and singlet is not SU(2) invariant. For
</p>
<p>example

singlet

</p>
<p>From the experience with mass terms for spin 1 fields, we know
</p>
<p>what to do: Instead of considering terms as above, we add SU(2)
</p>
<p>invariant coupling terms with 0 fields to the Lagrangian. Then, by
</p>
<p>choosing the vacuum value for the spin 0 field we break the symme-
</p>
<p>try and generate mass terms.
</p>
<p>A SU(2), U(1) and Lorentz invariant term, coupling a spin 0 dou-
</p>
<p>blet and our spin 12 fields together, is given by
</p>
<p>Ψ̄LΦψR. (7.127)
</p>
<p>To see the invariance we transform this term with a SU(2) trans-
</p>
<p>formation7474 Remember ΦL &rarr; Φ&prime;L = eibi(x)σi ΦL
and σ&dagger;i = σi</p>

<p>and equally for a U(1) transformation:

<p>Ψ̄LΦψR &rarr; Ψ̄&prime;LΦψ&prime;R = Ψ̄Le&minus;ia(x)Φeia(x)ψR = Ψ̄LΦψR �
</p>
<p>The spin 0 field does not transform at all under Lorentz transfor-
</p>
<p>mations75 and therefore the term is Lorentz invariant, because we 75 By definition a spin 0 field transforms
according to the (0, 0) representation
of the Lorentz group. In this represen-
tation all Lorentz transformations are
trivially the identity transformation.
This was derived in Section 3.7.4.
</p>
<p>have the same Lorentz invariant terms as in Eq. 7.125.
</p>
<p>This kind of term is called Yukawa term and we add it, with the
</p>
<p>equally allowed Hermitian conjugate to the Lagrangian76 &minus;λ2
76 The strange name &minus;λ2 and why only
add ψ2R here will become clear in a
moment, because terms including ψ1R
and &minus;λ1 will be discussed afterwards.
</p>
<p>L = &minus;λ2(Ψ̄LΦψ2R + ψ̄2RΦ̄ΨL). (7.128)
</p>
<p>The coupling constant λ2 is called a Yukawa coupling. This extra
</p>
<p>term does not only describe the interaction between the fermions and
</p>
<p>the Higgs field, but also leads to mass terms for the spin 12 fields after
</p>
<p>the symmetry breaking. We put the expansion around the vacuum
</p>
<p>expectation value (Eq. 7.88)

</p>
<p>We see that through the Higgs mechanism we get indeed the re-
</p>
<p>quired mass terms. Again, we used symmetry constraints to add a
</p>
<p>term to the Lagrangian and this yields after spontaneous symmetry
</p>
<p>breaking mass terms for the spin 12 fields. Take note that we only
</p>
<p>generated mass terms for the second field inside the doublet ψ2.
</p>
<p>What about mass terms for the first field ψ1?
</p>
<p>To get mass terms for the first field ψ1 we need to consider cou-
</p>
<p>pling terms to the charge-conjugated77 Higgs field Φ̃ = ǫΦ⋆, because 77 Charge conjugation is explained in
Section 3.7.10.</p>

</p>
<p>To understand the rather abstract spin 12 doublets better, we
</p>
<p>rewrite them more suggestively7878 A neutrino is always denoted by a ν.
In this step we simply give the two
fields in the doublet ψ1 and ψ2 their
conventional names: electron field e and
electron-neutrino field νe.
</p>
<p>Ψ =
</p>
<p>(
νe
e
</p>
<p>)
(7.134)
</p>
<p>and equivalently for the other leptons μ, νμ and τ, ντ . This form of
</p>
<p>the doublets is suggested by experiments, because an electron e is
</p>
<p>always transformed by weak interactions into another electron e, with
</p>
<p>possibly different momentum, or an electron-neutrino ve plus other
</p>
<p>particles. In weak interactions e and νe (equivalently μ and νμ or τ
</p>
<p>and ντ) always appear in pairs. This can be understood by looking

<p>at the coupling term Ψ̄γμWμPLΨ = Ψ̄γμ(Wμ)i σ

<p>If we want to consider all lepton generations at once, i.e. e, μ and τ,

</p>
<p>where l = e, μ, τ:

</p>
<p>Using the notation l =

<p>The terms for the corresponding neutrinos follow analogously80. 80 As already mentioned above, we
can only write down such mass terms
if there are right-chiral neutrinos.
However, so far right-chiral neutrinos
were never observed in experiments,
although we know that neutrinos have
mass. This is one of the open problems
of the standard model.
</p>
<p>This Lagrangian enables us to predict something about the Higgs
</p>
<p>field h that can be tested in experiments. For a given lepton l, the
</p>
<p>mass is given by
</p>
<p>ml =
λlv&radic;
2
&rarr; λl =
</p>
<p>ml
&radic;
2
</p>
<p>v
(7.137)
</p>
<p>and the coupling strength of this lepton to the Higgs is given by

2
</p>
<p>=︸︷︷︸
Eq. 7.137
</p>
<p>mlh
</p>
<p>v
. (7.138)
</p>
<p>The last equation means that the coupling strength of the Higgs
</p>
<p>to a lepton is proportional to the mass of the lepton. The heavier the
</p>
<p>lepton the stronger the coupling. The same is true for all particles
</p>
<p>and the derivation is completely analogous.
</p>
<p>There are other spin 12 particles, called quarks, that interact via
</p>
<p>the weak force. In addition, quarks interact via a third force, called
</p>
<p>the strong force and this will be the topic of Section 7.8, but first
</p>
<p>we want to talk about mass terms for quarks. Luckily, these can be
</p>
<p>incorporated analogous to the lepton mass terms.
</p>
<p>7.6 Quark Mass Terms
</p>
<p>We learned in the last section that an SU(2) doublet contains the
</p>
<p>particles that are transformed into each other via the weak force. For
</p>
<p>quarks81 these are the up- and down quark: 81 If you&rsquo;ve never heard of quarks
before, have a look at Section 1.3.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>166 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>and equally for the strange and charm or top and bottom quarks.
</p>
<p>Again, we must incorporate the experimental fact that only left-
</p>
<p>chiral particles interact via the weak force. Therefore, we have left-
</p>
<p>chiral doublets and right-chiral singlets:
</p>

</p>
<p>&rarr; uR
</p>
<p>dR︸︷︷︸
singlet
</p>
<p>&rarr; dR. (7.141)
</p>
<p>Again, right-chiral particles do not interact via the weak force and
</p>
<p>therefore they aren&rsquo;t transformed into anything and form a SU(2)
</p>
<p>singlet (=one component object).
</p>
<p>The problem is the same as for leptons: To get something Lorentz
</p>
<p>invariant, we need to combine left-chiral with right-chiral spinors.
</p>
<p>Such a combination is not SU(2) invariant and we use again the
</p>
<p>Higgs mechanism. This means, instead of terms like
</p>
<p>q̄LuR + q̄LdR + ūRqL + d̄RqL, (7.142)
</p>
<p>which aren&rsquo;t SU(2) invariant, we consider the coupling of the quarks
</p>
<p>to a spin 0 field doublet Φ:
</p>
<p>λu q̄LΦ̃uR + λd q̄LΦdR + λuūRΦ̃qL + λdd̄RΦqL, (7.143)
</p>
<p>with coupling constants λu,λd and the charge conjugated Higgs
</p>
<p>doublet82 which is needed in order to get mass terms for the up
</p>
<p>82 This is defined in Eq. 7.132:
</p>
<p>Φ̃ = ǫΦ⋆ =︸︷︷︸
</p>
<p>(
v+h&radic;
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>)
.
</p>
<p>quarks83.83 We defined the doublets as
(
</p>
<p>u
d
</p>
<p>)
.
</p>
<p>Multiplication of this doublet with
</p>
<p>Φ =
</p>
<p>(
0
</p>
<p>v+h&radic;
2
</p>
<p>)
always results in terms
</p>
<p>proportional to d.
</p>
<p>Then, everything is analogous to the lepton case: We put the
</p>
<p>expansion of the Higgs field around its minimum84 into the La-
</p>
<p>84 Φ =
</p>
<p>(
0
</p>
<p>v+h&radic;
2
</p>
<p>)
and equivalently for the
</p>
<p>charge-conjugated Higgs field.
</p>
<p>grangian, which gives us mass terms plus quark-Higgs coupling
</p>
<p>terms.
</p>
<p>7.7 Isospin
</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time we talk about the conserved quantity that follows from
</p>
<p>SU(2) symmetry. The free Lagrangians are only globally invari-
</p>
<p>ant and we need interaction terms to make them locally symmet-
</p>
<p>ric. Recall that global symmetry is a special case of local symmetry.
</p>
<p>Therefore we have global symmetry in every locally invariant La-
</p>
<p>grangian and the corresponding conserved quantity is conserved for</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interaction theory 167
</p>
<p>both cases. The result will be that global SU(2) invariance gives us
</p>
<p>through Noether&rsquo;s theorem, a new conserved quantity called isospin.
</p>
<p>This is similar to electric charge, which is the conserved quantity that
</p>
<p>follows from global U(1) invariance.
</p>
<p>Noether&rsquo;s theorem for internal symmetry (Section 4.5.5, especially
</p>
<p>Eq. 4.57) tells us that

</p>
<p>Therefore our infinitesimal variation is δΨ = iai
σi
2 Ψ, with arbitrary

<p>ai. This tells us we get one conserved quantity for each generator,
</p>
<p>because the Lagrangian is invariant regardless of if two of the three
</p>
<p>ai are zero and one isn&rsquo;t. For example, a2 = a3 = 0 and a1 �= 0 or
a1 = a2 = 0 and a3 �= 0. Of course we get another conserved quantity
for a1 �= 0, a2 �= 0 and a3 �= 0, which is just the sum of the conserved
quantities we get from the individual generators. In other words: we
</p>
<p>get three independently conserved quantities, one for each generator
</p>
<p>of SU(2).
</p>
<p>The globally invariant, free Lagrangian (Eq. 7.44) is

<p>for the conserved quantity i = 3. For the other generators, σ1 and σ2,
</p>
<p>our two components ve and e aren&rsquo;t eigenstates. We are of course free
</p>
<p>to choose a different basis, where for example σ2 is diagonal. Then
</p>
<p>we can simply redefine what we call ve and e and get the same result.
</p>
<p>The thing to take away is that although we have three conserved
</p>
<p>quantities, one for each generator, we can only use one at a time to
</p>
<p>label our particles/states.</p>

</p>
<p>7.7.1 Labelling States
</p>
<p>Recall that in Section 3.5, we introduced the notion of Cartan genera-
</p>
<p>tors, which is the set of diagonal generators of a given group. In the
</p>
<p>last section we learned that these generators become especially use-
</p>
<p>ful if we want to give new labels to our particles inside a doublet8686 In a later section we will learn that
the same can be done for triplets and
the conserved quantities following from
SU(3) invariance.
</p>
<p>object. A typical SU(2) doublet is of the form
</p>
<p>(
ve
e
</p>
<p>)
. (7.149)
</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t diagonalize two or more elements of the Lie algebra su(2)
</p>
<p>at the same time and thus the "Cartan subalgebra" consists of only
</p>
<p>only one element87. It is conventional to choose J3 =
1
2σ3 as diagonal.
</p>
<p>87 This can be seen by noting that there
are no commuting generators in su(2).
Only commuting generators can be
diagonalized at the same time.
</p>
<p>The corresponding eigenvalues are + 12 and &minus; 12 . A left-chiral neutrino(
ve
0
</p>
<p>)
is an eigenstate of this generator, with eigenvalue + 12 and a
</p>
<p>left-chiral electron
</p>
<p>(
0
</p>
<p>e
</p>
<p>)
an eigenstate of this generator, with eigen-
</p>
<p>value &minus; 12 . These are new particle labels, which are called the isospin
of the neutrino and the electron.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interaction theory 169
</p>
<p>Following the same line of thoughts we can assign an isospin
</p>
<p>value to the right-chiral singlets. These transform according to the
</p>
<p>one-dimensional representation of SU(2), and the generators are
</p>
<p>in this representation simply zero88: Ji = 0. Therefore, in this one- 88 The right-chiral singlets do not trans-
form at all as explained in Section 3.7.4.dimensional representation, the singlets are eigenstates of the Cartan
</p>
<p>generator J3 with eigenvalue zero. The right-chiral singlets, like eR
carry isospin zero. This coincides with the remarks above that right-
</p>
<p>chiral fields do not interact via the weak force. Just as electrically
</p>
<p>uncharged objects do not interact via electromagnetic interactions,
</p>
<p>fields without isospin do not take part in weak interactions.
</p>
<p>Finally, we can assign isospin values to the three gauge fields
</p>
<p>W
μ
+,W
</p>
<p>μ
&minus;,W
</p>
<p>μ
3 . The three gauge fields form a SU(2) triplet
</p>
<p>Wμ =

⎟⎠ , (7.150)
</p>
<p>which transforms according to the three dimensional representation
</p>
<p>of SU(2). In this representation the Cartan generator J3 has eigenval-
</p>
<p>ues89 +1,&minus;1, 0 and therefore we assign Q3(Wμ+) = 1, Q3(W
μ
&minus;) = &minus;1, 89 This can be seen directly from the
</p>
<p>explicit matrix form of J3 in Eq. 3.129:
</p>
<p>J3 =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎝
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 &minus;1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎠.
</p>
<p>Q3(W
μ
3 ) = 0. This is the isospin of the W+ and the W&minus; bosons.
</p>
<p>Take note that the triplet
(
</p>
<p>W
μ
1 W
</p>
<p>μ
2 W
</p>
<p>μ
3
</p>
<p>)
simply belongs to a differ-
</p>
<p>ent basis, where J3 isn&rsquo;t diagonal. This can be seen as another reason
</p>
<p>for our introduction of W
μ
&plusmn;.
</p>
<p>If this is unclear, have a look at how we introduced the three gauge
</p>
<p>fields W
μ
i . They were included into the Lagrangian in combination
</p>
<p>with the generators σiW
μ
i . This can be seen as a basis expansion of
</p>
<p>some objects Wμ in terms of the basis σi:
</p>
<p>Wμ = σiWμi = σ1W
μ
1 + σ2W
</p>
<p>μ
2 + σ3W
</p>
<p>μ
3 ,
</p>
<p>analogous to how we can write a vector in terms of basis vectors:
</p>
<p>�v = v1�e1 + v2�e2 + v3�e3.
</p>
<p>The generators σi live in the Lie algebra
90 of SU(2) and consequently 90 The Lie algebra is a vector space!
</p>
<p>our object Wμ lives there, too. Therefore, if we want to know how
Wμ transforms, we need to know the representation of SU(2) on this
</p>
<p>vector space, i.e. on its own Lie algebra. In other words: We need to
</p>
<p>know how the group elements of SU(2) act on their own Lie algebra
</p>
<p>elements, i.e. its generators. This may seem like a strange idea at
</p>
<p>first, but actually is a quite natural idea. Recall how we defined a
</p>
<p>representation: a representation is a map91 from the group to the 91 To be precise: A homomorphism,
which is a map that satisfies some
special conditions.
</p>
<p>space of linear operators over a vector space. So far we only looked</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>170 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>at "external" vector spaces like Minkowski space. The only intrinsic
</p>
<p>vector space that comes with a group is its Lie algebra92 ! Therefore
92 A group itself is in general no vector
space. Although we can take a look at
how the group acts on itself, this is not
a representation, but a realization of the
group.
</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t that strange to ask what a group representation on this vector
</p>
<p>space looks like. This very important representation is called the
</p>
<p>adjoint representation.
</p>
<p>Gauge fields (like W+,W&minus;,W3) are said to live in the adjoint rep-
resentation of the corresponding group. For SU(2) the Lie algebra is
</p>
<p>three dimensional, because we have three basis generators and there-
</p>
<p>fore the adjoint representation is three dimensional. Exactly how we
</p>
<p>are able to write the components of a vector between two brackets93,
93�v =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎝
</p>
<p>v1

</p>
<p>we can write the component of Wμ between two brackets94, which is

</p>
<p>what we call a triplet . The generators in the adjoint representation
</p>
<p>are connected to the three dimensional generator we derived earlier
</p>
<p>through a basis transformation.
</p>
<p>In the following section we move on to the "next higher" internal
</p>
<p>symmetry group SU(3). Demanding local SU(3) invariance of the
</p>
<p>Lagrangian gives us the correct Lagrangian which describes strong
</p>
<p>interactions.
</p>
<p>7.8 SU(3) Interactions
</p>
<p>For three fermion fields we can find a locally SU(3) invariant La-
</p>
<p>grangian in exactly the same way we did in the last chapter for two
</p>
<p>fields and SU(2). This symmetry is not broken and the correspond-
</p>
<p>ing spin 1 fields, called gluon fields, are massless. SU(3) is the group
</p>
<p>of all unitary 3&times; 3 matrices with unit determinant, i.e.
</p>
<p>U&dagger;U = UU&dagger; = 1 detU = 1. (7.151)
</p>
<p>As usual for Lie groups we can write this as an exponential func-
</p>
<p>tion9595 As already noted in Section 2.4,
Capital Roman letters A, B, . . . are
always summed from 1 to 8.
</p>
<p>U = eiTAθA . (7.152)
</p>
<p>The defining equations (Eq. 7.151) of the group require, as for96
</p>

given by the 2&times; 2 Pauli matrices.

</p>
<p>T&dagger;A = TA (7.153)

<p>tr(TA) = 0 . (7.154)
</p>
<p>A basis for those traceless, Hermitian generators is, at least in one
</p>
<p>representation, given by eight97 3 &times; 3 matrices, called Gell-Mann97 It can be shown that in general for
SU(N) the Lie-Algebra is N2 &minus; 1

</p>
<p>as we will learn in Chapter 6.called quarks. If we want to talk about quarks we have to consider
</p>
<p>quite a lot of things:
</p>
<p>&bull; Quarks are SU(3) triplets, denoted by Q. Inside a triplet we have
</p>
<p>the same quark, say an up-quark, in different colors: U =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>ur
ub
ug
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠.
</p>
<p>The triplets always appear in pairs Q̄Q in order to get something
</p>
<p>SU(3) invariant, exactly as we always need doublet pairs in order
</p>
<p>to get something SU(2) invariant. Instead of writing Q̄Q, we can
</p>
<p>use an index notation: Q̄Q = q̄cqc, where the index c stands for
</p>
<p>color c = r, g, b.
</p>
<p>&bull; In addition, left-chiral quarks are SU(2) doublets, because they
</p>
<p>interact via the weak force, too. Each object in this doublet107 107 Each quark doublet consists of two
different quarks, for example an up-
and a down-quark or a top- and a
bottom-quark.
</p>
<p>(=each quark) is a triplet: q =
</p>
<p>(
uc
dc
</p>
<p>)
. This can become very confus-
</p>
<p>ing, very fast and therefore the color index c is suppressed unless
</p>
<p>strong interactions are considered.
</p>
<p>&bull; As if this weren&rsquo;t enough, we need to remember that each quark
</p>
<p>is described by a Dirac spinor, which consits of two Weyl spinors</p>

. The upper Weyl-Spinor describes a left-chiral and
</p>
<p>the lower component the same quark with right-chirality.
</p>
<p>Having talked about this, let&rsquo;s return to SU(3) interactions. Hap-
</p>
<p>pily, there is no experimental need for mass terms for the gauge
</p>
<p>bosons in the Lagrangian, because all experiments indicate that the
</p>
<p>gauge bosons of SU(3), called gluons, are massless. Therefore SU(3)
</p>
<p>is not broken.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SU(3) symmetry poses no new problems regard-
</p>
<p>ing mass terms for the fermions in the triplet, because a term of the
</p>
<p>form
</p>
<p>Q̄mQ (7.166)
</p>
<p>is SU(3) invariant, as long as all particles in the triplet have equal
</p>
<p>mass. This means m is proportional to the unit matrix108. The objects
108 m = m
</p>
<p>⎛
⎝
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎠, instead of
</p>
<p>m = m
</p>
<p>⎛
⎝
</p>
<p>m1 0 0
0 m2 0
0 0 m3
</p>
<p>⎞
⎠
</p>
<p>inside a triplet describe the same quark in different colors, which
</p>
<p>indeed have equal mass. For example, for an up-quark the triplet is
</p>
<p>U =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>ur
ub
ug
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ , (7.167)
</p>
<p>where ur denotes a red, ub a blue and ug green up-quark, which all
</p>
<p>have the same mass.
</p>
<p>The other spin 12 particles, like electrons or neutrinos, do not carry
</p>
<p>color and therefore do not couple to gluons. The interactions fol-
</p>
<p>lowing from local SU(3) invariance are called strong interactions,
</p>
<p>because the coupling constant is much bigger than for electromag-
</p>
<p>netic (U(1)) or weak (SU(2)) interactions.
</p>
<p>7.9 The Interplay Between Fermions and Bosons
</p>
<p>This section summarizes what we discovered in this chapter and
</p>
<p>puts it in a more physical context. We will learn later that spin 12
fields create and destroy spin 12 particles. Analogously, spin 1 fields
</p>
<p>create and destroy spin 1 particles. In this chapter we derived the
</p>
<p>Lagrangians that describe how different fields and therefore particles
</p>
<p>interact with each other.
</p>
<p>As already mentioned in Section 1.3 we call spin 12 particles
</p>
<p>fermions and spin 1 particles bosons. The standard interpretation
</p>
<p>is that fermions make up matter and bosons mediate the forces be-
</p>
<p>tween matter. We can now understand how this comes about.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interaction theory 175
</p>
<p>We started the chapter with Lagrangians describing free fields,
</p>
<p>which we derived in Chapter 6. Then we discovered internal sym-
</p>
<p>metries for the Lagrangian describing one, two or three free spin 12
fields. These internal symmetries are only global symmetries, which
</p>
<p>is quite unconvincing because of special relativity. More natural
</p>
<p>would be local symmetries.
</p>
<p>We then discovered that we could make the Lagrangians locally
</p>
<p>invariant by introducing additional coupling terms. These coupling
</p>
<p>terms describe the interaction of our spin 12 fields with new spin 1
</p>
<p>fields. For historic reasons the internal symmetries here are called
</p>
<p>gauge symmetries and we therefore call these new spin 1 fields,
</p>
<p>gauge fields. Through Noether&rsquo;s theorem we get for each inter-
</p>
<p>nal symmetry new conserved quantities. These are interpreted as
</p>
<p>charges, analogous to electric charge that follows for U(1) symmetry.
</p>
<p>&bull; To get a locally U(1) invariant Lagrangian, we need one gauge
</p>
<p>field Aμ. The final Lagrangian describes correctly electromagnetic
</p>
<p>interactions. U(1) symmetry tells us that electric charge is con-
</p>
<p>served.
</p>
<p>&bull; To get a locally SU(2) invariant Lagrangian, we need three gauge
</p>
<p>fields W
μ
1 ,W
</p>
<p>μ
2 ,W
</p>
<p>μ
3 . The final Lagrangian describes correctly weak
</p>
<p>interactions. SU(2) symmetry tells us that isospin is conserved.

<p>&bull; To get a locally SU(3) invariant Lagrangian, we need eight such
</p>
<p>fields G
μ
1 , G
</p>
<p>μ
2 , . . .. The final Lagrangian describes correctly strong
</p>
<p>interactions. SU(3) symmetry tells us that color is conserved.
</p>
<p>Different gauge bosons (spin 1 particles) are responsible for a
</p>
<p>different kind of force. The electromagnetic force is mediated by
</p>
<p>photons, which is created by the U(1) gauge field Aμ. The weak
</p>
<p>force is mediated by W+,W&minus; and Z bosons and the strong force by 8
different gluons, which are created by the corresponding SU(2) and
</p>
<p>SU(3) gauge fields.
</p>
<p>In addition, we discovered that SU(2) symmetry forbids mass
</p>
<p>terms in the Lagrangian. From experiments we know this is incorrect.
</p>
<p>The solution that enables us to include mass terms without spoiling
</p>
<p>any symmetry is the Higgs mechanism. It works by including addi-
</p>
<p>tional terms, describing coupling of our spin 1 and spin 12 fields to a
</p>
<p>new spin 0 field, called the Higgs field. By breaking SU(2) symme-
</p>
<p>try spontaneously and expanding the Higgs field around a new, no
</p>
<p>longer symmetric minimum, we get the required mass terms in the
</p>
<p>Lagrangian.</p>

<p>Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>In this chapter we will talk about quantum mechanics. The founda-
</p>
<p>tion for everything here are the identifications we discussed in Chap-
</p>
<p>ter 5. As a first result, we derive the relativistic energy-momentum
</p>
<p>relation.
</p>
<p>After a discussion of how the quantum formalism works, we take
</p>
<p>the non-relativistic limit of the Klein-Gordon equation, because this
</p>
<p>is the equation of motion for the simplest type of particles: scalars.
</p>
<p>This results in the famous Schr&ouml;dinger equation. The solution of this
</p>
<p>equation is interpreted as a probability amplitude and two simple
</p>
<p>examples are analysed using this wave-mechanic approach.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Dirac notation is introduced, which is useful to
</p>
<p>understand the general structure of quantum mechanics. In this no-
</p>
<p>tation, the initial state of a system is denoted by an abstract state
</p>
<p>vector |i〉, called ket. The probability amplitude for measuring this
initial state in a specific final state can then be computed formally
</p>
<p>by multiplying it with a bra, denoted 〈 f |. The combination of a bra
with a ket results in a complex number that is interpreted as prob-
</p>
<p>ability amplitude A for the process i &rarr; f . The probability for this
process is |A|2. Then we talk about projection operators. We will
see how they can be used, together with the completeness relation,
</p>
<p>to expand an arbitrary state in the eigenstate basis of an arbitrary
</p>
<p>operator. The previously used wave-mechanics can then be seen as
</p>
<p>a special case, where we expand the states in the location basis. In
</p>
<p>the Dirac notation the Schr&ouml;dinger equation is used to compute the
</p>
<p>time-evolution of states. To make the connection explicit, we use the
</p>
<p>Dirac notation to reanalyze an example which we already solved
</p>
<p>using wave-mechanics.

<p>8.1 Particle Theory Identifications
</p>
<p>The equations we derived so far1 can be used in particle- and field-1 The Klein-Gordon, Dirac, Proka and
Maxwell equations theories. In this chapter we want to investigate how they can be used
</p>
<p>in a particle-theory. Our dynamic variables are then the location, the
</p>
<p>angular momentum, the energy and the momentum of the particle
</p>
<p>in question. As explained in Chapter 5, we identify these with the
</p>
<p>generators of the corresponding symmetry2:2 See Eq. 3.248, Eq. 3.252 and Chapter 5
</p>
<p>&bull; momentum p̂i = &minus;i&part;i,
</p>
<p>&bull; location x̂i = xi,
</p>
<p>&bull; energy Ê = i&part;0,
</p>
<p>&bull; angular momentum L̂i = i
1
2ǫijk(x
</p>
<p>j&part;k &minus; xk&part;j).
Before we discuss how these operators are used in quantum me-
</p>
<p>chanics, we use them to derive one of the most important equations
</p>
<p>of modern physics.
</p>
<p>8.2 Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation
</p>
<p>In Section 6.2 we derived the equation of motion for a free spin 0
</p>
<p>particle, the Klein-Gordon equation:
</p>
<p>(&part;μ&part;
μ + m2)Φ = 0.
</p>
<p>With the identifications reiterated above this equation reads3
</p>
<p>3 Using pμ =

</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>(&part;μ&part;
μ + m2)Φ = (&part;0&part;0 &minus; &part;i&part;i + m2)Φ
</p>
<p>=

</p>
<p>)

</p>
<p>)
Φ
</p>
<p>= (&minus;E2 + �p2 + m2)Φ = 0 . (8.1)
Therefore
</p>
<p>&rarr; E2 = �p2 + m2 or using four-vectors pμpμ = m2 , (8.2)
which is the famous energy-momentum relation of special-relativity.
</p>
<p>For a particle at rest (�p = 0) this gives us Einstein&rsquo;s famous equation
</p>
<p>E2 = m2 &harr; E = mc2
</p>
<p>where we restored c2 for clarity. We can now understand why we
</p>
<p>gave the scalar value of the first Casimir operator of the Poincar&eacute;
</p>
<p>group pμp
μ the suggestive name m2 (Eq. 3.266). The combination
</p>
<p>pμp
μ is indeed the squared mass of the particle in question, which
</p>
<p>can be measured in experiments, for example, by measuring the
</p>
<p>energy and momentum of the particle: m =
&radic;
</p>
<p>E2 &minus; �p2. For the same
reason, we understand now why the constant in the Lagrangian we
</p>
<p>derived in Section 6.2 is also called m2.</p>

</p>
<p>8.3 The Quantum Formalism
</p>
<p>Now that our physical quantities are given by operators, we need
</p>
<p>something they can act on. First take note that we have for each
</p>
<p>operator a set of eigenfunctions, which is completely analogous to
</p>
<p>the eigenvectors of matrices. Matrices are finite-dimensional and
</p>
<p>therefore we get finite dimensional eigenvectors. Here our operators
</p>
<p>act on an infinite-dimensional vector space and we therefore have
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions. For example, the equation we must solve to get the
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of the momentum operator is
</p>
<p>&minus;i&part;i︸︷︷︸
operator
</p>
<p>Ψ = pi︸︷︷︸
eigenvalue
</p>
<p>eigenfunction︷︸︸︷
Ψ , (8.3)
</p>
<p>with some number pi. A solution is
</p>
<p>Ψ = C︸︷︷︸
=const
</p>
<p>eipixi because
</p>
<p>&rarr; &minus;i&part;iCeipixi = piCeipixi � (8.4)
</p>
<p>but take note that this a solution for arbitrary pi. Therefore we have
</p>
<p>found an infinite number of eigenfunctions for the momentum opera-
</p>
<p>tor p̂i = &minus;i&part;i. Equivalently, we can search for energy eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>i&part;0Φ = EΦ (8.5)
</p>
<p>or angular momentum eigenfunctions4. Analogous to eigenvectors 4 The discussion for angular momentum
eigenfunctions is a bit more compli-
cated, because the operator is more
complicated than the others. We can&rsquo;t
find a set of eigenfunctions for all three
components at the same time, because
[L̂i , L̂j] �= 0. This will be discussed in
a moment. The final result of a lengthy
discussion is that the corresponding
eigenfunctions of the third component
of the angular momentum operator L̂3
(and of the squared angular momentum
operator L̂2, which commutes with all
components [L̂2, L̂j] = 0) are the famous
spherical harmonics. These form an
orthonormal basis.
</p>
<p>for matrices, these eigenfunctions are bases for the corresponding ab-
</p>
<p>stract vector space5. This means we can expand an arbitrary function
</p>
<p>5 Recall that for matrices the eigenvec-
tors are a basis for the corresponding
vector space.
</p>
<p>Ψ in terms of eigenfunctions. For example, we can expand Ψ in terms
</p>
<p>of momentum eigenfunctions6 (for brevity in one dimension)
</p>
<p>6 Take note that this is exactly the
Fourier transform of a function Ψ,
which is introduced in Appendix D.1
and the factor 1&radic;
</p>
<p>2π
is a matter of
</p>
<p>convention.
</p>
<p>Ψ =
1&radic;
2π
</p>
<p>&int; &infin;
</p>
<p>&minus;&infin;
dpΨpe
</p>
<p>&minus;ipx, (8.6)
</p>
<p>where Ψp are the coefficients in this expansion analogous to v1, v2, v3
in �v = v1�e1 + v2�e2 + v3�e3.
</p>
<p>For some systems we have boundary conditions such that we
</p>
<p>have a discrete instead of a continuous basis. Then we can expand
</p>
<p>an arbitrary state, for example, in terms of discrete set of energy
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions ΦEn :
</p>
<p>Ψ = &sum;
n
</p>
<p>cnΦEn . (8.7)
</p>
<p>An important observation is that, in general, a set of eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>for one operator is not a set of eigenfunctions for another operator.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>180 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Only for operators that commute [A, B] = AB &minus; BA = 0, we can find
a simultaneous set of eigenfunctions for both operators. We don&rsquo;t
</p>
<p>prove this here, but to see the connection between a common set of
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions and the commutator property, let&rsquo;s assume we have
</p>
<p>two commutating operators [A, B] = 0 &rarr; AB = BA. For the set of
eigenfunctions Ψi that belong to A, we have AΨi = aiΨi, where ai
denotes the corresponding eigenvalues. Now, we can calculate77 The brackets () are used here solely
</p>
<p>for illustrative purposes.
</p>
<p>A(BΨi) =︸︷︷︸
AB=BA
</p>
<p>BAΨi =︸︷︷︸
AΨi=aiΨi
</p>
<p>BaiΨi
</p>
<p>ai is just a number︷︸︸︷
= ai(BΨi) . (8.8)
</p>
<p>This shows that (BΨi) is also an eigenfunction of A for all Ψi, with
</p>
<p>exactly the same eigenvalues ai. Therefore the only difference be-
</p>
<p>tween (BΨi) and Ψi can be a constant: BΨi = biΨi. We conclude that
</p>
<p>the A eigenfunctions Ψi are also eigenfunctions of B if AB = BA
</p>
<p>holds.
</p>
<p>In general our operators act on something we call8 Ψ, which de-8 The usage of Ψ is conventional in
quantum mechanics and we use it here,
although we used it so far exclusively
for spinors, to describe spin 0 particles,
too.
</p>
<p>notes the state of the physical system in question. We get this Ψ, by
</p>
<p>solving the corresponding equation of motion.
</p>
<p>Usually, such a solution will have more than one term if we expand
</p>
<p>it in some basis. For example, consider a state that can be written in
</p>
<p>terms of two energy eigenstates9 Ψ = c1ΦE1 + c2ΦE2 . Acting with the
9 This means all other coefficients in the
expansion Ψ = &sum;n cnΦEn are zero. energy operator on this state yields
</p>
<p>ÊΨ = Ê(c1ΦE1 + c2ΦE2) = c1E1ΦE1 + c2E2ΦE2 �= E(c1ΦE1 + c2ΦE2).
(8.9)
</p>
<p>A superposition of states with different energy is therefore, in gen-
</p>
<p>eral, no eigenstate of the energy operator, because for an eigenstate
</p>
<p>we have by definition ÊΨ = EΨ for some number E. But what is
</p>
<p>then the energy of the system described by Ψ? What does it mean
</p>
<p>that a state is a superposition of two energy eigenstates? How can we
</p>
<p>interpret all this in physical terms?
</p>
<p>A first hint towards an interpretation is the U(1) symmetry of
</p>
<p>our Lagrangians, which shows us that the solution of an equation
</p>
<p>of motion Ψ cannot be directly physically relevant10. Secondly, we10 If we assume that Ψ describes our
particle directly in some way, what
would the U(1) transformed solution
Ψ&prime; = eiαΨ, which is equally allowed,
describe?
</p>
<p>observe that a solution to any equation of motion we derived so far is
</p>
<p>a function of11 �x and t, i.e. Ψ = Ψ(�x, t).
</p>
<p>11 This will be made explicit in the next
sections.
</p>
<p>The standard interpretation is that the absolute value squared
</p>
<p>|Ψ(�x, t)|2 of the wave function Ψ(�x, t) gives the probability density
of its location. Observe that the U(1) symmetry has no influence on
</p>
<p>this quantity |Ψ|2 = Ψ&dagger;Ψ &rarr; (Ψ&prime;)&dagger;(Ψ)&prime; = Ψ&dagger;e&minus;iαeiαΨ = Ψ&dagger;Ψ. In</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>quantum mechanics 181
</p>
<p>other words: Ψ(x, t) is the probability amplitude that a measurement
</p>
<p>of the location gives a value in the interval [x, x + dx]. Consequently
</p>
<p>we have, if we integrate over all space
</p>
<p>&int;
dxΨ⋆(x, t)Ψ(x, t)
</p>
<p>!
= 1, (8.10)
</p>
<p>which is called the normalization prescription, because the probabil-
</p>
<p>ity for finding the particle anywhere in space must be 100% = 1.
</p>
<p>If we want to make predictions about any other physical quantity,
</p>
<p>we must expand the wave-function in terms of the corresponding
</p>
<p>basis. For example, we can expand it in terms of energy eigenfunc-
</p>
<p>tions: Ψ = c1ΦE1 + c2ΦE2 + . . .. Then, the standard interpretation of
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics is: the probability for measuring a given energy
</p>
<p>value E1 for the system described by Ψ is given by the absolute value
</p>
<p>squared of the overlap between Ψ and ΦE1
</p>
<p>P(E1) =
∣∣∣
&int;
</p>
<p>dxΦ⋆E1(x, t)Ψ(x, t)

.
</p>
<p>In the example above this means
</p>
<p>P(E1) =

<p>dxΦ⋆E1(x, t)Ψ(x, t)

</p>
<p>Analogously, when we expand some other Ψ(�x, t) in terms of mo-

</p>
<p>we have Ψ̃(�p, t) as the probability amplitude for finding the system
</p>
<p>with momentum in the interval [p, p + dp].
</p>
<p>This interpretation can be used to make probabilistic predictions
</p>
<p>about the system, for example using the statistical expectation value,
</p>
<p>which is the topic of the next section. Afterwards we will derive the
</p>
<p>equation of motion for non-relativistic quantum mechanics and look
</p>
<p>at two examples.
</p>
<p>8.3.1 Expectation Value
</p>
<p>In statistics the expectation value is defined in analogy to the weighted
</p>
<p>average. For example, if tossing a dice ten times results in 2, 4, 1, 3, 3,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>182 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>6, 3, 1, 4, 5, the average value is

<p>〈x〉 = (2+ 4+ 1+ 3+ 3+ 6+ 3+ 1+ 4+ 5) &middot; 1
10
</p>
<p>= 3.2.
</p>
<p>An alternative way of computing this is to collect equal results and
</p>
<p>weighing them by their empirical probability:
</p>
<p>〈x〉 = 2
10
</p>
<p>&middot; 1+ 1

</p>
<p>&middot; 4+ 1
10
</p>
<p>&middot; 5+ 1
10
</p>
<p>&middot; 6 = 3.2.
</p>
<p>We can write this in general as
</p>
<p>〈x〉 = &sum;
i
</p>
<p>ρixi (8.12)
</p>
<p>where ρi denotes the probability. Equally for a continuous distribu-
</p>
<p>tion we have
</p>
<p>〈x〉 =
&int;
</p>
<p>dxρ(x)x (8.13)
</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics the expectation value for a physical quan-
</p>
<p>tity Ô is defined analogously
</p>
<p>〈Ô〉 =
&int;
</p>
<p>d3xΨ⋆ÔΨ. (8.14)
</p>
<p>In general, we must expand Ψ in terms of eigenfunctions of Ô, for
</p>
<p>example momentum eigenfunctions. Then, acting with the operator

<p>In the next section, we consider the non-relativistic limit of the
</p>
<p>Klein-Gordon equation and will derive this way the equation of mo-
</p>
<p>tion of non-relativistic quantum mechanics12.12 It is also possible to consider the non-
relativistic limit of the other equations
that we have derived so far. For exam-
ple, the Dirac equation becomes in the
non-relativistic limit the Pauli equation.
However, these additional equations
are less important for the goals of this
book.

<p>8.4 The Schr&ouml;dinger Equation
</p>
<p>The Klein-Gordon equation is solved by plane waves
</p>
<p>Φ = e&plusmn;ipμx
μ &equiv; e&plusmn;ip&middot;x ,
</p>
<p>where pμ = (E,�p)T is the conserved four-momentum of the particle.

<p>quantum mechanics 183
</p>
<p>We now write the solution with a minus sign a little differently
</p>
<p>Φ = e&minus;ipμx
μ
= Φ = ei(&minus;Et+�p&middot;�x)
</p>
<p>and then we see that the time dependence is given by e&minus;iEt, i.e.
Φ &prop; e&minus;iEt. From Eq. 8.2 we know the energy is
</p>
<p>E =
&radic;
�p2 + m2 =
</p>
<p>&radic;
m2(
</p>
<p>�p2
</p>
<p>m2
+ 1) = m
</p>
<p>&radic;
�p2
</p>
<p>m2
+ 1.
</p>
<p>In the non-relativistic limit |�p| ≪ m, i.e. for an object that moves
much slower than the speed of light, which implies that its momen-
</p>
<p>tum is much smaller than its mass, we can approximate the energy
</p>
<p>using the Taylor-series as
</p>
<p>E = m
</p>
<p>&radic;
�p2

<p>m2

<p>= m(1+

<p>+

</p>
<p>. (8.17)
</p>
<p>We can therefore write
</p>
<p>Φ = ei(&minus;Et+�p&middot;�x) &asymp; e&minus;imt ei�p&middot;�x&minus;i(�p2/2m)t︸ ︷︷ ︸
&equiv;φ(�x,t)
</p>
<p>= e&minus;imtφ(�x, t). (8.18)
</p>
<p>From |�p| ≪ m it follows that the rest-mass is much bigger than
the kinetic energy and therefore the remaining time dependence in
</p>
<p>φ(�x, t) oscillates more slowly than e&minus;imt. If we put our ansatz into the
Klein-Gordon equation we get
</p>
<p>(&part;μ&part;
μ + m2)e&minus;imtφ(�x, t) = (&part;t&part;t &minus; &part;i&part;i + m2)e&minus;imtφ(�x, t) = 0.
</p>
<p>Then we use &part;te
&minus;imt(. . .) = e&minus;imt(&minus;im + &part;t)(. . .), which is just the
</p>
<p>product rule, twice. This yields
</p>
<p>e&minus;imt((&minus;im + &part;t)2 &minus; &part;i&part;i + m2)φ(�x, t) = 0,
</p>
<p>which we can divide by e&minus;imt, because this never becomes zero.
Therefore
</p>
<p>&rarr; ((&minus;im + &part;t)2 &minus;&nabla;2 + m2)φ(�x, t) = 0
&rarr; (&minus;m2 &minus; 2im&part;t + (&part;t)2 &minus;&nabla;2 + m2)φ(�x, t) = 0 .

</p>
<p>which is the famous Schr&ouml;dinger equation. When we now make

<p>which is the usual non-relativistic energy-momentum relation.
</p>
<p>From this point-of-view, it is easy to see how we can include an exter-

<p>erators, for example, the operator for the kinetic energy &nabla;

<p>8.5 From Wave Equations to Particle Motion
</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s look at two examples of how the standard interpretation of
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics works in practice.
</p>
<p>8.5.1 Example: Free Particle
</p>
<p>A solution for the free (without external potential) Schr&ouml;dinger equa-
</p>
<p>tion (Eq. 8.21) is given by
</p>
<p>Ψ = e&minus;i(Et&minus;�p�x) (8.25)
</p>
<p>because
</p>
<p>i&part;te
&minus;i(Et&minus;�p�x) != &minus;&nabla;
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>2m
e&minus;i(Et&minus;�p�x)
</p>
<p>&rarr; Ee&minus;i(Et&minus;�p�x) != �p
2
</p>
<p>2m
e&minus;i(Et&minus;�p�x) � , (8.26)
</p>
<p>where E is just the numerical value for the total energy of the free
</p>
<p>particle, which was derived in Eq. 8.22 as E =
�p2
</p>
<p>2m . A more general
</p>
<p>solution is a linear combination
</p>
<p>Ψ = Ae&minus;i(Et&minus;�p�x) + Be&minus;i(E
&prime;t&minus;�p&prime;�x) + . . . .

</p>
<p>We interpret the wave-function as a probability amplitude and
</p>
<p>therefore it must be normalized, because the total probability for
</p>
<p>finding the particle must be 100% = 1. This is not possible for the
</p>
<p>wave-function above which spreads out over all of space. To describe
</p>
<p>an individual free particle we have to use a suited linear combination,
</p>
<p>called a wave-packet:
</p>
<p>ΨWP(�x, t) =
&int;
</p>
<p>dp3A(�p)ei(�p�x&minus;Et), (8.27)
</p>
<p>where the complex numbers A(�p) have to be chosen in a way that
</p>
<p>makes the wave packet normalizable. One possibility is a Gaussian</p>

<p>An example of such a Gaussian wave-packet is plotted in Fig. 8.1.

<p>For many computations clever tricks can be used in order to avoid

<p>working with complicated wave packets, allowing us to work with

<p>simple wave functions instead.

</p>
<p>Now we look at one of the standard examples of quantum mechan-
</p>
<p>ics: a particle confined in a box, here 1-dimensional, with infinitely
</p>
<p>high potential walls. Inside the box the potential is zero, outside it&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>infinite (see Fig. 8.2).

<p>The potential is defined piece-wise

<p>{
0, 0 &lt; x &lt; L
</p>
<p>&infin;, otherwise
(8.28)

<p>and therefore, we have to solve the one-dimensional Schr&ouml;dinger

<p>i&part;tΨ(x, t) = &minus;
&part;2x

<p>Ψ(x, t) + V(x)Ψ(x, t)
</p>
<p>piece-wise.
</p>
<p>&bull; Inside the box, the solution is equal to the free particle solution,
</p>
<p>because V(x) = 0 for 0 &lt; x &lt; L.
</p>
<p>&bull; Outside, because here V(x) = &infin;, the only possible, physical
</p>
<p>solution is Ψ(x, t) = 0.
</p>
<p>We can rewrite the general free particle solution as1313 Using sin(x) = 12i
(
eix &minus; e&minus;ix
</p>
<p>)
and
</p>
<p>cos(x) = 12
(
eix + e&minus;ix
</p>
<p>)
, which follows
</p>
<p>directly from the series expansion of
cos(x), sin(x) and eix as derived in
Appendix B.4.1.
</p>
<p>Ψ(x, t) = Ae&minus;i(Et&minus;px) + Be&minus;i(Et+px)
</p>
<p>=
(
C sin(px) + D cos(px)
</p>
<p>)
e&minus;iEt ,
</p>
<p>which we can rewrite again using the non-relativistic energy-momentum

<p>relation (Eq. 8.22)

</p>
<p>cause of the probabilistic interpretation16.16 A probability of more than 1 = 100%
doesn&rsquo;t make sense.

<p>Next we can ask17, what is the probability for measuring the parti-

</p>
<p>Next we want to introduce a useful notation invented by Dirac,
</p>
<p>which extremely helpful to understand the structure of quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics.
</p>
<p>8.5.3 Dirac Notation
</p>
<p>In the Dirac notation the state of a physical system is denoted ab-
</p>
<p>stractly by
</p>
<p>|Ψ〉 , (8.35)
which is called a ket21. For example, if we prepare a particle in a box 21 The pun will become clear in a
</p>
<p>second.in an energy eigenstate we have
</p>
<p>Ĥ |Φn〉 = En |Φn〉 .
</p>
<p>To each ket we can define a bra, denoted by 〈Ψ| which is given by
</p>
<p>〈Ψ| = |Ψ〉&dagger; , (8.36)
</p>
<p>where the &dagger; symbol (called dagger) denotes the Hermitian conjugate,
</p>
<p>i.e. transposing plus complex conjugation. A bra is an object that acts
</p>
<p>on a ket. We can define an inner product as follows:
</p>
<p>(|Φ〉 , |Ψ〉) &equiv; 〈Φ|Ψ〉 .
</p>
<p>If a ket is multiplied with a bra from the left-hand side, the result is a
</p>
<p>complex number
</p>
<p>〈Φ|Ψ〉 = c . (8.37)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>190 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>This complex number is the probability amplitude for a physical sys-
</p>
<p>tem in the state |Ψ〉 to be measured in the state |Φ〉. Consequently,
the probability is given by | 〈Φ|Ψ〉 |2. For example, the probabil-
ity amplitude for finding a particle in the state |Ψ〉 in the interval
[x, x + dx] is given by
</p>
<p>〈x|Ψ〉 &equiv; Ψ(x).
This is the wave function we used in the last chapters. Furthermore,
</p>
<p>we could ask: What&rsquo;s the probability amplitude for finding the same
</p>
<p>particle with momentum in the interval [p, p + dp]? The answer in
</p>
<p>the Dirac notation is
</p>
<p>〈p|Ψ〉 &equiv; Ψ(p).
Recall that our states must fulfil a normalization condition, be-
</p>
<p>cause we are using a probabilistic interpretation22. For example, we22 The probability for finding the par-
ticle anywhere must be 100% = 1 or
equally the probability for finding the
particle with any momentum must be
100% = 1. In other words: the sum of
probabilities for all possible outcomes
must add up to 1.
</p>
<p>have &int;
dx|Ψ(x, t)|2 =
</p>
<p>&int;
dxΨ⋆(x, t)Ψ(x, t)
</p>
<p>!
= 1 (8.38)
</p>
<p>and equally
</p>
<p>&int;
dp|Φ(p, t)|2 =
</p>
<p>&int;
dpΦ⋆(p, t)Φ(p, t)
</p>
<p>!
= 1 (8.39)
</p>
<p>or written in our new notation
&int;
</p>
<p>dx| 〈x|Ψ〉 |2 =
&int;
</p>
<p>dx(〈x|Ψ〉)&dagger; 〈x|Ψ〉 =
&int;
</p>
<p>dx 〈Ψ|x〉 〈x|Ψ〉 != 1 (8.40)
</p>
<p>and
&int;
</p>
<p>dp| 〈p|Φ〉 |2 =
&int;
</p>
<p>dp(〈p|Φ〉)&dagger; 〈p|Φ〉 =
&int;
</p>
<p>dp 〈Φ|p〉 〈p|Φ〉 != 1 . (8.41)
</p>
<p>We can see here a new kind of operator: |p〉 〈p| and |x〉 〈x|, which
are called projection operators23. They are operators because they23 Exactly like the projection operators
</p>
<p>for left-chiral and right-chiral spinors
we introduced earlier, these projection
operators fulfil the defining condition
P2 = P.
</p>
<p>transform a ket into another ket. For example,
</p>
<p>|x〉 〈x|Ψ〉︸ ︷︷ ︸
=some complex function we call Ψ(x)
</p>
<p>= |x〉Ψ(x),
</p>
<p>which is again a ket, because the product of a complex function with
</p>
<p>a ket is again a ket. In general, an operator is any object that acts on
</p>
<p>a ket to generate another ket. Looking at Eq. 8.40 motivates us to
</p>
<p>introduce another operator
</p>
<p>&int;
dx 〈Ψ|x〉 〈x|Ψ〉 = 〈Ψ|
</p>
<p>(&int;
dx |x〉 〈x|
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>︸ ︷︷ ︸
&equiv; Î
</p>
<p>|Ψ〉 = 〈Ψ| Î |Ψ〉 != 1. (8.42)
</p>
<p>From this we can conclude
</p>
<p>Î |Ψ〉 != |Ψ〉 (8.43)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>quantum mechanics 191
</p>
<p>for an arbitrary ket |Ψ〉, because 〈Ψ|Ψ〉 = 1. This follows, because
the probability for a system prepared in state the |Ψ〉 to be found
in the state |Ψ〉, must be, of course, 100% = 1. For example, if we
prepare a particle to be at some point x0, the probability for finding
</p>
<p>it at point x0 is 1. Therefore, 〈x0|x0〉 = 1. Because of this, Î is called
the unit operator and plays the same role as the number 1 in the
</p>
<p>multiplication of numbers. The result
</p>
<p>&int;
dx |x〉 〈x| = Î (8.44)
</p>
<p>or for a discrete basis
</p>
<p>&sum;
i
</p>
<p>|i〉 〈i| = Î (8.45)
</p>
<p>are called completeness relations. In general, we say the component
</p>
<p>of a ket |a〉 in the basis |i〉 is
</p>
<p>|i〉&dagger; |a〉 &equiv; 〈i|a〉 &equiv; ai,
</p>
<p>which is a complex number. Using the completeness relation, i.e.
</p>
<p>&sum;i |i〉 〈i| = Î, we can write
</p>
<p>|a〉 = &sum;
i
</p>
<p>|i〉 〈i|a〉 = &sum;
i
</p>
<p>|i〉 ai.
</p>
<p>This can be seen as the series expansion24 of the ket |a〉 in terms of 24 Analogous to how we can write
a vector in terms of a given basis:
�v = v1�e1 + v2�e2 + v3�e3, as explained in
Appendix A.1.
</p>
<p>the basis |i〉. Consequently, the complex numbers ai can be seen as
the expansion coefficients. Equally for a continuous complete basis,
</p>
<p>we have

&equiv;Ψ(x) complex number
</p>
<p>=
&int;
</p>
<p>dx |x〉Ψ(x).
</p>
<p>The expectation value we introduced in Section 8.3.1 is in the Dirac
</p>
<p>notation given by
</p>
<p>〈Ô〉 = 〈Ψ| Ô |Ψ〉 .
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s return to the example of the particle in a box, and solve it
</p>
<p>using the Dirac notation.
</p>
<p>8.5.4 Example: Particle in a Box, Again
</p>
<p>The question we asked was: What is the probability for finding the
</p>
<p>particle having energy E = E2 =
n2π2
</p>
<p>2mL2
? This question can be an-
</p>
<p>swered in the Dirac notation in a very natural way. The probability is
</p>
<p>given by

<p>which is exactly the result we derived using the standard wave me-

<p>chanics in Section 8.5.2. All of this becomes much clearer as soon as
</p>
<p>you learn more about quantum mechanics and solve some problems
</p>
<p>on your own, using both notations.
</p>
<p>8.5.5 Spin
</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to return to the operator we derived in Section 5.1.1
</p>
<p>for a new kind of angular momentum, we called spin. So far we have
</p>
<p>two loose ends. On the one hand, we have used spin as a label for
</p>
<p>the representations of the Lorentz group. For example, if we want
</p>
<p>to describe an elementary particle with spin 12 , we have to use an
</p>
<p>object transforming according to the spin 12 representation. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, we derived from rotational symmetry something that we
</p>
<p>called spin, too25. In the quantum framework, when we act with the25 The conserved quantity that follows
from invariance under rotations has
two parts. One part follows from
the invariance under rotations of the
spacetime coordinates and is called
orbital angular momentum. The second
parts follows from the invariance under
the mixing of the field components. See
Section 4.5.4.
</p>
<p>operator that we derived in Section 5.1.1 on a given state, the result
</p>
<p>is the spin of the particle. For the scalar representation, this operator
</p>
<p>is given by Ŝ = 0, which of course always yields 0 when with it on a
</p>
<p>state Ψ.
</p>
<p>For the ( 12 , 0) representation we have to use the two-dimensional
</p>
<p>representation of the rotation generator, which was derived in Sec-
</p>
<p>tion 3.7.5
</p>
<p>Ŝi =
σi
2
</p>
<p>(8.46)
</p>
<p>and where σi denotes the Pauli matrices. If we want to know the spin
</p>
<p>of a particle described by Ψ, we have to act with the spin-operator on
</p>
<p>Ψ. For example, for Ŝ3 this will give us the spin of the corresponding
</p>
<p>particle in the 3-, or more familiar called z-direction. Analogously for
</p>
<p>Ŝ2 in the y- and Ŝ1 in the x-direction.
</p>
<p>The explicit form of the operator Ŝ3 is
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.3: Illustration of the Stern-
Gerlach experiment. The original exper-
iment was performed with silver atoms,
whose spin behavior is dominated
by the one electron in the outermost
atomic orbital. The experimental re-
sult is the same as with electrons. A
beam of particles is affected by an in-
homogeneous magnetic field. For a
classical type of angular momentum
the deflection of the particles through
the magnetic field should be a con-
tinuous distribution. Measured are
just two deflection types, i.e. the beam
splits in two parts, one corresponding
to spin 12 and one to &minus; 12 . Figure by

<p>quantum mechanics 193
</p>
<p>This means a particle described by a spinor26 has spin 12 , which can
26 Recall that a spinor is an object
transforming according to the ( 12 , 0), the
</p>
<p>(0, 12 ) or (
1
2 , 0)&oplus; (0, 12 ) representation.
</p>
<p>be aligned or anti-aligned to some arbitrary measurement axis. This
</p>
<p>is why we call this representation spin 12 representation
27. In the
</p>
<p>27 Analogous statements can be made
for the spin 1 or other higher represen-
tations.
</p>
<p>quantum framework this is interpreted by saying that a measurement
</p>
<p>of spin can only result in 12 and &minus; 12 . In Section 4.5.4 we learned that
spin is something similar to orbital angular momentum, because
</p>
<p>both notions arise from rotational invariance. Here we can see that
</p>
<p>this kind of angular momentum gives quite surprising results, when
</p>
<p>measured. The most famous experiment proving this curious fact of
</p>
<p>nature is the Stern-Gerlach experiment (see Fig. 8.3).
</p>
<p>The same is true for a measurement of spin in any direction. A
</p>
<p>measurement of the spin in the x-,y- or z-direction can only result in
1
2 and &minus; 12 .
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one concrete example of how a spin-measurement
</p>
<p>works in the quantum formalism. As mentioned above, the explicit
</p>
<p>form of the spin operator (Eq. 5.4), say for a measurement along the
</p>
<p>z-axis, is
</p>
<p>Ŝz =
1
</p>
<p>2
σ3 =
</p>
<p>(
1
2 0
</p>
<p>0 &minus; 12
</p>
<p>)
. (8.49)
</p>
<p>The eigenstates are | 12 〉z =̂
(
1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>)
and |&minus; 12 〉z =̂
</p>
<p>(
0
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>)
, where the sub-
</p>
<p>script z denotes that we are dealing with eigenstates of Ŝz. A gen-
</p>
<p>eral spinor is not a spin-eigenstate, but a superposition |X〉 =
a | 12 〉z + b |&minus; 12 〉z. The coefficients depend on how we prepare a given
particle. If we did a measurement of the spin along the z-axis and
</p>
<p>filtered out all particles with spin &minus; 12 , the coefficient b would be zero
and a would be 1. Without any measurement and filtering the co-
</p>
<p>efficients are a = b = 1&radic;
2
, which means probability28 12 for each
</p>
<p>28 The coefficients are directly related
to the probability amplitude which
we need to square in order to get the
probability. This will be shown in a
moment.
</p>
<p>possibility. Things get interesting if we make a measurement along
</p>
<p>the z-axis and afterwards a measurement, for example, along the x-
</p>
<p>axis. Even if we did filter out all &minus; 12 components along the z-axis,
there will be particles with spin &minus; 12 along the x-axis.
</p>
<p>Acting with the spin operator Ŝz on a state means measuring spin
</p>
<p>along the z-axis. For a general state |X〉 both outcomes + 12 and &minus; 12
are possible and the probability is directly related to the factors a and
</p>
<p>b. If we want to know the probability for measuring &minus; 12 , the quan-
tum formalism tells us that the corresponding probability amplitude
</p>
<p>is
</p>
<p>z

</p>
<p>Therefore, the probability for measuring spin &minus; 12 along the z-axis is
Pz=&minus; 12
</p>
<p>= |b|2. If we want to measure the spin along another axis, say
the x-axis, we need to expand our two states in terms of the eigen-

along the x-axis we are in the state |X〉after x-axis filtering = | 12 〉x.
</p>
<p>&bull; Now measuring the spin along the z-axis again, gives us the
</p>
<p>surprising result that the probability for measuring spin &minus; 12 is

</p>
<p>and therefore we are again getting components with spin &minus; 12
along the z-axis, even though we did filter these out in the first
</p>
<p>step!

</p>
<p>8.6 Heisenberg&rsquo;s Uncertainty Principle
</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to talk about one of the most curious features of quan-
</p>
<p>tum mechanics. We learned in the last section that a measurement of
</p>
<p>spin in the x-direction makes everything we knew previously about
</p>
<p>spin along the z-direction useless. This kind of thing happens for
</p>
<p>many observables in quantum mechanics. We can trace this behavior
</p>
<p>back to the fact that30 ŜxŜz �= ŜzŜx. This means that a measurement30 Recall that we identify the spin
operators with the corresponding
finite-dimensional representations for
the rotation generators. These fulfil
the commutator relation [Ji , Jj] =
Ji Jj &minus; Jj Ji = iǫijk Jk �= 0 &rarr; Ji Jj �= Jj Ji . For
example, if we describe spin 12 particles,
we must use the two-dimensional
representation Ji =
</p>
<p>σi
2 .
</p>
<p>of spin along the z-axis followed by a measurement of spin along
</p>
<p>the x-axis is different from a measurement of spin along the x-axis
</p>
<p>followed by a measurement of spin along the z-axis. After measur-
</p>
<p>ing the spin along the z-axis the system is in an eigenstate of Ŝz and
</p>
<p>after a measurement of spin along the x-axis, in an eigenstate of Ŝx.
</p>
<p>The eigenstates for Ŝz and Ŝx are all different and therefore this is no
</p>
<p>surprise.
</p>
<p>We can look at this from a different perspective: We aren&rsquo;t able
</p>
<p>to know the spin of a system along the z-axis and the x-axis at the
</p>
<p>same time! Each time we measure spin along the z-axis the spin
</p>
<p>along the x-axis becomes undetermined and vice-versa. The same
</p>
<p>is true for spin along the z-axis/x-axis and spin along the y-axis.
</p>
<p>Spin may be something really strange, but we can observe the same
</p>
<p>behavior for measurements of position and momentum. Take a look
</p>
<p>again at Eq. 5.3, which we recite here for convenience:
</p>
<p>[ p̂i, x̂j] = p̂i x̂j &minus; x̂j p̂i = iδij. (8.62)
</p>
<p>Following the line of thought as above tells us that a measurement of
</p>
<p>momentum in the x-direction changes what we can expect for a mea-
</p>
<p>surement of position on the x-axis. In other words this means that
</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t know position and momentum in the same direction at the
</p>
<p>same time with arbitrary precision. Take note that the commutator is
</p>
<p>only non-zero for measurements along the same axis31. A measure-31 The Kronecker delta δij is zero for
i �= j and one for i = j as defined in
Appendix B.5.5.
</p>
<p>ment of momentum in the y-direction has no influence on what we
</p>
<p>can expect for the position on the x-axis.
</p>
<p>Everytime we measure momentum the position becomes uncertain
</p>
<p>and vice versa. This is known as Heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainty principle.
</p>
<p>Analogous observations can be made for angular momentum along
</p>
<p>different axes, because the commutator for the corresponding oper-
</p>
<p>ator is non-zero, too. In general, we can check for any two physical
</p>
<p>quantities if they commute with each other. If they don&rsquo;t, we know
</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t be measured at the same time with arbitrary precision.
</p>
<p>Maybe this shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us. Quantum mechanics uses the
</p>
<p>generators of the corresponding symmetries as measurement oper-</p>
<p/>

<p>quantum mechanics 197
</p>
<p>ators. For instance, this has the consequence that a measurement of
</p>
<p>momentum is equivalent to the action of the translation generator32. 32 Recall that invariance under trans-
lations leads us to conservation of
momentum.
</p>
<p>The translation generator moves our system a little bit and there-
</p>
<p>fore the location is changed. What is more surprising is that nature
</p>
<p>actually works this way. Over the years there have been many experi-
</p>
<p>mental tests of the Heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainty principle and all proved
</p>
<p>it to be correct.
</p>
<p>8.7 Comments on Interpretations
</p>
<p>The interpretation and notations described in this chapter are the
</p>
<p>standard ones. Nevertheless, there are other formalisms equally
</p>
<p>powerful. For example, the Feynman path integral formalism33 is, 33 To learn more about this see for
example, Richard P. Feynman and
Albert R. Hibbs. Quantum Mechanics and
Path Integrals: Emended Edition. Dover
Publications, emended editon edition, 7
2010. ISBN 9780486477220
</p>
<p>in terms of results, completely equivalent to the wave mechanics,
</p>
<p>we described in this chapter. Yet computations in this formalism
</p>
<p>are completely different. If we want to compute the probability for
</p>
<p>a particle to get from point a to point b, we have to sum over all
</p>
<p>possible paths that a particle can go between a and b. As absurd as it
</p>
<p>sounds, this approach leads to the same result, which can be proved
</p>
<p>formally as well. Freeman Dyson once told the story34 34 Harry Woolf, editor. Some Strangeness
in the Proportion. Addison-Wesley, 1st
edition, 2 1981. ISBN 9780201099249
</p>
<p>Dick Feynman told me about his "sum over histories" version of quan-
</p>
<p>tum mechanics. "The electron does anything it likes," he said. "It just
</p>
<p>goes in any direction at any speed, forward or backward in time, how-
</p>
<p>ever it likes, and then you add up the amplitudes and it gives you the
</p>
<p>wavefunction." I said to him, "You&rsquo;re crazy." But he isn&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>Another interpretation for the basic equations of quantum me-
</p>
<p>chanics, further away from the mainstream, is Bohmian Mechanics.
</p>
<p>The starting point is to put the ansatz: ReSt into the Schr&ouml;dinger
</p>
<p>equation. Separating the imaginary and real part results in two
</p>
<p>equations, one of which can be seen as completely analogous to the
</p>
<p>Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics plus an additional
</p>
<p>term. This additional term can be interpreted as an extra potential,
</p>
<p>which is responsible for the strange quantum effects. Further com-
</p>
<p>putations are completely analogous to classical mechanics. A new
</p>
<p>force is computed from the extra potential using the gradient, which
</p>
<p>is then put into Newton&rsquo;s classical equation: F = ma. Therefore, in
</p>
<p>Bohmian mechanics one still has classical particle trajectories. The
</p>
<p>results from this approach are, as far as I know, equal to those com-
</p>
<p>puted by standard non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Nevertheless,
</p>
<p>this approach has fallen into disfavour because the extra potential
</p>
<p>undergoes non-local changes.</p>

</p>
<p>Components
</p>
<p>In this and the corresponding appendices, u and v denote two-component
</p>
<p>objects inside a Dirac spinor and u and v four-component objects. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple u1 and u2 describe two different four-component objects. For a general

</p>
<p>and u2, i.e. u =
</p>
<p>(
u1
u2
</p>
<p>)
.
</p>
<p>Up to this point we have been relatively vague about the two Weyl
</p>
<p>spinors inside a Dirac spinor. What do they stand for? How can they
</p>
<p>be interpreted? In addition, each such Weyl spinor inside a Dirac
</p>
<p>spinor consists of two components. How to interpret these? Now, we
</p>
<p>are finally in the position to give answers to these questions.
</p>
<p>In short:
</p>
<p>&bull; The two Weyl spinors χL, ξR inside a Dirac spinor ψ =
</p>
<p>(
χL
ξR
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>describe "different particles". Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s conventional to
</p>
<p>call them the same particle, for example an electron, with different
</p>
<p>chirality:
</p>
<p>&ndash; χL describes a left-chiral electron,
</p>
<p>&ndash; ξR describes a right-chiral electron,</p>
<p/>

<p>quantum mechanics 199
</p>
<p>but the crucial point is that these are really distinct particles/fields39, 39 They are labelled by different quan-
tum numbers and therefore behave
differently in experiments!
</p>
<p>because they aren&rsquo;t related by a parity transformation or charge
</p>
<p>conjugation. This is why we use different symbols. There is, of
</p>
<p>course, some sort of connection between them, which is why we
</p>
<p>write them in one object. This will be discussed in detail in a mo-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>&bull; The two components of each Weyl spinor describe different spin
</p>
<p>configurations40 of the corresponding particle. 40 This was discussed in Section 8.5.5.
Recall that spin can be measured
like angular momentum, but for a
spin 12 particle the result of such a
</p>
<p>measurement can only be + 12 or &minus; 12 ,
no matter what axis we choose. These
two measurement results are commonly
called spin up and spin down.
</p>
<p>&ndash; A Weyl spinor proportional to
</p>
<p>(
1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>)
describes a particle with
</p>
<p>spin up
</p>
<p>&ndash; A Weyl spinor proportional to
</p>
<p>(
0
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>)
describes a particle with
</p>
<p>spin down
</p>
<p>&ndash; Any other Weyl spinor is simply a mixture of spin up and spin
</p>
<p>down.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this comes about in detail:
</p>
<p>The important thing we learn from weak interactions and parity
</p>
<p>violation is that left-chiral and right-chiral particles are really differ-
</p>
<p>ent particles. Left-chiral particles carry weak charge (isospin) and
</p>
<p>therefore interact via the weak force. Right chiral particles do not,
</p>
<p>which was explained in Section 7.7.1.
</p>
<p>We have for every particle in nature a corresponding antiparticle
</p>
<p>and in general, we get the antiparticle description through charge
</p>
<p>conjugation. Charge conjugation flips all particle labels, which in-
</p>
<p>cludes isospin. Let&rsquo;s see what particles we can expect that are related
</p>
<p>to, say electrons. We have
</p>
<p>&bull; A left-chiral electron χL, with isospin &minus; 12 and electric charge &minus;e,
which is part of a doublet.
</p>
<p>&bull; A right-chiral anti-left-chiral-electron (χL)
c = χR with isospin
</p>
<p>1
2 ,
</p>
<p>electric charge +e, which is part of a doublet, too. This property
</p>
<p>does not simply vanish through charge conjugation. This may be
</p>
<p>confusing at the moment, but so far we have only talked about the
</p>
<p>coupling of the weak force to particles. It turns out that the weak
</p>
<p>force couples to right-chiral antiparticles as well.
</p>
<p>&bull; A right-chiral electron ξR with isospin 0 and electric charge &minus;e
</p>
<p>&bull; A left-chiral anti-right-chiral-electron (ξR)
c = ξL with isospin 0 and
</p>
<p>electric charge +e</p>

<p>200 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Therefore, when talking about electrons, we have in fact four differ-
</p>
<p>ent "things" we need to consider. These are all really different par-
</p>
<p>ticles and we need to give them different names! Usually one talks
</p>
<p>about just two particles related to an electron: The electron and the
</p>
<p>positron and we will see how this comes about in a moment.
</p>
<p>We restrict the following discussion to the rest frame of the particles
</p>
<p>in question. In other frames the discussion works analogous but is more
</p>
<p>cumbersome.
</p>
<p>The objects inside a Dirac spinor and its charge conjugate are
</p>
<p>directly related to these four particles. The physical electron and the
</p>
<p>physical positron are commonly identified as the solutions of the
</p>
<p>Dirac equation. The Dirac equation is an equation of motion, i.e. an
</p>
<p>equation that determines the dynamics of the particles in question.
</p>
<p>The explicit solutions are Dirac spinors that evolve in time. We need
</p>
<p>such Dirac spinors with a definite time-evolution in order to describe
</p>
<p>how our particles evolve in time. As we will see this requires that we
</p>
<p>always use two of the particles listed above at once.
</p>
<p>An explicit derivation of the solutions of the Dirac equation can be
</p>
<p>found in the appendix Section 8.9. Here we just use the results. There
</p>
<p>are four independent solutions of the Dirac equation and two are of
</p>
<p>the form
</p>
<p>ψi =
</p>
<p>(
ui

</p>
<p>)
(8.63)
</p>
<p>with for example41 u1 =

</p>
<p>)
e&minus;imt and u2 =
</p>
<p>(

</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>)
e&minus;imt and two41 This is a basis choice. The only
</p>
<p>requirement is that they are linearly
independent. solutions are of the form
</p>
<p>ψ̃i =

<p>(

</p>
<p>)
, (8.64)
</p>
<p>with for example v1 =

<p>(

</p>

</p>
<p>)
e+imt and v2 =
</p>
<p>(
0
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>)
e+imt
</p>
<p>The Dirac equation tells us that the spin configuration of the two
</p>
<p>particles described by the upper and lower Weyl spinors inside a
</p>
<p>Dirac spinor, are directly related. In addition, their time depen-
</p>
<p>dence must be the same. These solutions describe what is commonly
</p>
<p>known as a physical electron and a physical positron, with different
</p>
<p>spin configurations42.42 Take note that the connection between
these objects is charge conjugation. This
can be seen by using the explicit form
of the charge conjugation operator:
ψc1 = iγ2ψ
</p>
<p>⋆
1 . Therefore: (ψ1)
</p>
<p>c = ψ̃2 and
(ψ2)
</p>
<p>c = ψ̃1.
</p>
<p>&bull; ψ1 is an electron with spin up
</p>
<p>&bull; ψ2 is an electron with spin down</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>quantum mechanics 201
</p>
<p>&bull; ψ̃1 is a positron with spin up
</p>
<p>&bull; ψ̃2 is a positron with spin down
</p>
<p>We can see nicely that a physical electron has a left-chiral (the up-
</p>
<p>per two components) and a right-chiral part (the lower two compo-
</p>
<p>nents). For a physical electron the spin configuration of the left-chiral
</p>
<p>and the right-chiral part and the time-dependence must be the same
</p>
<p>for both parts. As discussed above, this left-chiral and right-chiral
</p>
<p>parts are really different, because they have different weak charge!
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to describe a dynamical, physical electron we
</p>
<p>always need both parts.
</p>
<p>Take note that these solutions do not mean that the object we use
</p>
<p>to describe a physical electron consists of exactly the same upper and
</p>
<p>lower two-component objects. Only their spin configuration and their
</p>
<p>time dependence must be equivalent. The upper object is still part
</p>
<p>of a doublet, whereas the lower object isn&rsquo;t. The upper object trans-
</p>
<p>forms under SU(2) transformations and the lower doesn&rsquo;t. Using the
</p>
<p>notation from above we have
</p>
<p>physical electron =
</p>
<p>(
χL
ξR
</p>
<p>)
&prop;
</p>
<p>(
u
</p>
<p>u
</p>
<p>)
. (8.65)
</p>
<p>This does not mean that χL = ξR. The Weyl spinor χL is part of a
</p>
<p>doublet and describes a particle with isospin, whereas the particle
</p>
<p>described by ξR has isospin zero. In addition, we already know that
</p>
<p>the upper and lower Weyl spinor inside a Dirac spinor transform dif-
</p>
<p>ferently under Lorentz boosts. Therefore it is important that we use
</p>
<p>different symbols. In other words: The object describing a left-chiral
</p>
<p>electron χL carries an additional SU(2) index, because χL transforms
</p>
<p>as part of a doublet under SU(2) transformations. ξR has no such
</p>
<p>index and transforms as a singlet under SU(2) transformations.
</p>
<p>Equivalently we have

<p>The message to take away is that the physical electron we observe

<p>left-chiral electron that carries isospin and the right-chiral electron

<p>with isospin zero! Equivalently the physical positron is a mixture of
</p>
<p>an anti-left-chiral electron, which carries isospin and an anti-right-
</p>
<p>chiral electron with isospin zero.
</p>
<p>The solutions of the Dirac equation tell us how our particles evolve
</p>
<p>in time. Let&rsquo;s say we start with an electron with spin up that was
</p>
<p>created in a weak interaction and is therefore purely left-chiral. How
</p>
<p>does this particle evolve in time? A purely left-chiral electron with

</p>
<p>particle and vice versa. To describe the time-evolution of a particle
</p>
<p>like an electron we need eL and eR, which is why we wrote them
</p>
<p>together in one object: the Dirac spinor. The same is true for the
</p>
<p>positron.
</p>
<p>Recall that the two different particles eL and eR, carry different
</p>
<p>weak charge, i.e. isospin. Nevertheless as time evolves these two
</p>
<p>particles can transform into each other. Most of the time it will be a
</p>
<p>mixture of both and not a definite eigenstate. Isospin and chirality
</p>
<p>are therefore not conserved as time evolves, only in interactions.
</p>
<p>We can now see that the notation with Dirac spinors is necessary,
</p>
<p>because we have a close, dynamical connection between each two
</p>
<p>particles of the four particles listed at the beginning of this section.
</p>
<p>Chirality and therefore isospin are not conserved during propagation.
</p>
<p>A propagating electron can sometimes be found as left-chiral and
</p>
<p>sometimes as right-chiral.
</p>
<p>8.9 Appendix: Solving the Dirac Equation
</p>
<p>As explained at the beginning of the last section, we use here the symbols
</p>
<p>u and v for the two-component objects inside a Dirac spinor, and u and v
</p>
<p>for four-component objects. This means, for example u1 and u2 describe
</p>
<p>two different four-component objects. If we don&rsquo;t want to be specific and
</p>
<p>want to consider both four-component objects at the same time we simply
</p>
<p>write u. Then u1 and u2 are the two two-component objects inside such a
</p>
<p>four-component object u =
</p>
<p>(
u1
u2
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>In this appendix we will solve the Dirac equation in the rest frame
</p>
<p>in the chiral basis. The solution for an arbitrary frame can be com-
</p>
<p>puted by acting with a boost transformation on the solution derived
</p>
<p>in this section. In addition to the discussion in the last section, we
</p>
<p>will use these solutions in Chapter 9, when we talk about quantum
</p>
<p>field theory. The Dirac equation is
</p>
<p>(i&part;μγ
μ &minus; m)ψ = 0. (8.72)
</p>
<p>Anticipating plane wave solutions, we make the ansatz Ψ = ue&minus;ipx,
with some four-component object u, because the matrices γμ in the
</p>
<p>equation are 4&times; 4. In the rest frame, which means momentum zero
�p = 0, the exponent reduces to &minus;ipx = &minus;i(p0x0 &minus; �p�x) = &minus;ip0x0.
Now using the relativistic energy-momentum relation E =
</p>
<p>&radic;
�p + m2,
</p>
<p>which we derived at the beginning of this chapter, and using that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>+m2t = &minus;imt.
</p>
<p>Putting this ansatz into the Dirac equation yields
</p>
<p>(i&part;μγ
μ &minus; m)ue&minus;imt = 0
</p>
<p>&rarr; (i(&part;0γ0 + &part;iγi)&minus; m)ue&minus;imt = 0

<p>The 1 inside the remaining matrix here is the 2&times; 2 unit matrix and
therefore u1 and u2 are two-component objects. We see that our

<p>ansatz solves the equation, if u1 = u2. Therefore, we have found

<p>two linearly independent solutions of the Dirac equation

</p>
<p>We can find two other solutions by making the ansatz Ψ̃ = veipx,

<p>which analogously reduces in the rest frame to Ψ̃ = veimt. This

<p>ansatz yields

<p>8.10 Appendix: Dirac Spinors in Different
</p>
<p>Bases
</p>
<p>In the Lagrangian the Dirac spinors ψ appear always in combination
</p>
<p>with the matrices γμ. This can be used to simplify computations, by
</p>
<p>switching to a different basis. This works, because we can add terms
</p>
<p>of the form 1 = N&minus;1N, with some arbitrary invertible matrix N,
between ψ and γμ and then redefine both. For example
</p>
<p>&part;μψ̄γμψ = &part;μψ̄ N
&minus;1N︸ ︷︷ ︸
=1
</p>
<p>γμ N
&minus;1N︸ ︷︷ ︸

</p>
<p>The basis we worked with in this text so far is called the chiral basis
</p>
<p>or Weyl basis. Conventionally the Dirac equation is solved in another
</p>
<p>basis, called mass basis or Dirac basis. In the chiral basis we worked
</p>
<p>with so far, the Dirac Lagrangian
</p>
<p>LD = iχ&dagger;Lσμ&part;μχL + iξ&dagger;Rσ̄μ&part;μξR &minus; mχ&dagger;LξR &minus; mξ&dagger;RχL (8.78)
</p>
<p>has non-diagonal mass terms, i.e. mass terms that mix different
</p>
<p>states. We can use the freedom to choose a basis to pick a basis
</p>
<p>where the mass terms are diagonal, which is then called mass ba-
</p>
<p>sis.
</p>
<p>This means we want a mass term ψ&dagger;mψ, with m =
</p>
<p>(
m1 0
</p>
<p>0 m2
</p>
<p>)
,
</p>
<p>which gives us mass terms of the form

<p>The latter basis, which we worked with so far, makes it easy to inter-
</p>
<p>pret things in terms of chirality, whereas it&rsquo;s easier for Dirac spinors

<p>in the mass basis to make the connection to physical propagating
</p>
<p>particles.
</p>
<p>To find the connection between the second and the first form, we

<p>Equivalently we can make the ansatz ψ = veipx, which yields

veipx = 0

<p>&rarr;

v = 0.
</p>
<p>Analogously to our solution in the chiral basis, we work in the rest
</p>
<p>frame, i.e. �p = 0. We are allowed to make such a choice, because
</p>
<p>physics is the same in all frames of reference and therefore we can
</p>
<p>pick one that fits our needs best. In this frame of reference, with
</p>
<p>pi = 0, we have

u = 0

<p>In addition, we have p0 = E and we can use the relativistic energy-

<p>ter (Eq. 8.2). In the rest frame we have E =

<p>Quantum Field Theory
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>In this chapter the framework of quantum field theory is introduced.
</p>
<p>Starting with the equation derived in Chapter 5
</p>
<p>[Φ(x),π(y)] = iδ(x &minus; y),
</p>
<p>we are able to see that the fields themselves are operators. The so-
</p>
<p>lutions of the equations of motion for spin 0, 12 and 1 are written in
</p>
<p>terms of their Fourier expansions1. Using the commutation rela- 1 The idea behind the Fourier transform
is explained in Appendix D.1.tion, cited above, we discover that the Fourier coefficients are now
</p>
<p>operators. Afterwards, we will see how these operators, and with
</p>
<p>them of course the fields, create and annihilate particles. Using the
</p>
<p>Lagrangian for the corresponding fields, we are able to derive the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian operator representing energy.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, we start developing interaction theory, which is what
</p>
<p>quantum field theory is all about. We will see that in interaction the-
</p>
<p>ory, the Hamiltonian is given by a linear combination of the Hamilto-
</p>
<p>nian for the free field plus an interaction Hamiltonian. This insight
</p>
<p>can then be used in the interaction picture, where the time evolu-
</p>
<p>tion of the fields is governed by the free Hamiltonian and the time
</p>
<p>evolution of the states by the interaction Hamiltonian. Using this pic-
</p>
<p>ture, we are able to derive the probability amplitudes for scattering
</p>
<p>processes. These are denoted in the Dirac notation
</p>
<p>〈 f | Ŝ |i〉 ,
where Ŝ denotes the operator describing the scattering process, |i〉
is the initial state and 〈 f | is the final state. We will discover that the
operator Ŝ can be written in terms of the interaction Hamiltonian HI :
</p>
<p>Ŝ(t, ti) = e
&minus;i
</p>
<p>&int; t
ti
</p>
<p>dt&prime;HI .

</p>
<p>This can&rsquo;t be solved and therefore we evaluate the exponential
</p>
<p>in terms of its series expansions. For most experiments the first few
</p>
<p>terms suffice to get an accurate description.
</p>
<p>Each term in this series expansion can be interpreted physically
</p>
<p>as describing a different kind of scattering process. The interaction
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian contains linear combinations of the fields, which create
</p>
<p>and annihilate particles as mentioned above. For the first non-trivial
</p>
<p>order, we get 8 terms and we will see that the first term describes a
</p>
<p>scattering process of the form e&minus;e+ &rarr; γ. This means we start with an
initial state |e&minus;e+〉 consisting of an electron and a positron, which are
annihilated by the field operators of the spin 12 fields and afterwards
</p>
<p>a photon 〈γ| is created by the photon field. The other terms result in
zero when operating on this initial state |e&minus;e+〉.
</p>
<p>The next order in the series expansion consists of many, many
</p>
<p>terms and we will take a look at just one of them. Again, we start
</p>
<p>with an initial state |e&minus;e+〉 and we will see that one term describes
the process e&minus;e+ &rarr; γ &rarr; e&minus;e+, where the initial and final electron
and positron have, in general, completely different momenta.
</p>
<p>In exactly the same way, all terms can be interpreted for all inter-
</p>
<p>action Hamiltonians. A pictorial way to simplify these kinds of com-
</p>
<p>putations are the famous Feynman diagrams. Each line and vertex in
</p>
<p>such a diagram represents a factor of the kind mentioned above.
</p>
<p>9.1 Field Theory Identifications
</p>
<p>In this section, we want to understand how the Lagrangians that we
</p>
<p>derived from symmetry constraints can be used in a field theoret-
</p>
<p>ical framework. The first step in deriving a field theory describing
</p>
<p>nature is combining the Lagrangians we found with the result from
</p>
<p>Chapter 5, specifically Eq. 5.5, which we recite here for convenience:
</p>
<p>[Φ(x),π(y)] = iδ(x &minus; y), (9.1)
where the conjugate momentum density π(y) is given by
</p>
<p>π(y) =
&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;(&part;0Φ(y))

<p>9.2 Free Spin 0 Field Theory

<p>"Every act of creation is first of all an act of destruction."

to Create. W. W. Norton and Com-
pany, reprint edition, 3 1994. ISBN
9780393311068
</p>
<p>Again, let&rsquo;s start with the simplest possible case: free spin 0 fields.
</p>
<p>We describe such fields with scalars, which are objects that do not
</p>
<p>change at all under Lorentz transformations3. We already derived in 3 This was derived in Section 3.7.4
</p>
<p>Chapter 6.2 the corresponding Lagrangian
</p>
<p>L =
1
</p>
<p>2
(&part;μΦ&part;
</p>
<p>μΦ &minus; m2Φ2) (9.3)
</p>
<p>and the equation of motion, called Klein-Gordon equation
</p>
<p>(&part;μ&part;
μ + m2)Φ = 0. (9.4)
</p>
<p>Using the Lagrangian in Eq. 9.3, we can calculate the conjugate mo-
</p>
<p>mentum
</p>
<p>π(x) =
&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;(&part;0Φ(x))
=
</p>
<p>&part;
</p>
<p>&part;(&part;0Φ(x))
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
(&part;μΦ(x)&part;
</p>
<p>μΦ(x)&minus;m2Φ2(x)) = &part;0Φ(x) .
</p>
<p>The most general solution of the Klein-Gordon equation can be writ-
</p>
<p>ten in terms of its Fourier-expansion4 4 See the appendix in Section 9.6 at
the end of this chapter for a detailed
computation of the integral measure
and a justification for writing the
solution like this.

</p>
<p>)
, (9.5)
</p>
<p>with (ωk)
2 &equiv;�k2 + m2. For real scalar fields we can rewrite this as

<p>Φ(x) =

</p>
<p>(2π)32ωk
</p>
<p>(

<p>)

c
</p>
<p>+Re(c)&minus; i &middot; Im(c)︸ ︷︷ ︸
c&dagger;
</p>
<p>= 2Re(c).
</p>
<p>Now we are having a look at the implications of Eq. 9.1, i.e. the
</p>
<p>non vanishing commutator [Φ(x),π(y)] �= 0. This means that Φ(x)
and π(y) cannot be ordinary functions, but must be operators, be-
</p>
<p>cause ordinary functions commute: (3 + x)(7xy) = (7xy)(3 + x).
</p>
<p>By looking at Eq. 9.6, we conclude that the Fourier-coefficients a(k)
</p>
<p>and a(k)&dagger; are operators, because e&plusmn;i(kx) is just a complex number and
complex numbers commute.
</p>
<p>Using Eq. 9.1 we can compute5 5 See for example chapter 4.1 in

ory. Cambridge University Press, 2nd

<p>[a&dagger;(k), a&dagger;(k&prime;)] = 0 . (9.9)
</p>
<p>Now that we know that our field itself is an operator, the logical
</p>
<p>next thing to ask is: What does it operate on? In a particle theory,
</p>
<p>we identify the dynamical variables as operators acting on something
</p>
<p>describing a particle (the wavefunction, an abstract Dirac vector, etc.).
</p>
<p>In a field theory we have up to now nothing to describe a particle.
</p>
<p>At this point, it is completely unclear how particles appear in a field
</p>
<p>theory. Nevertheless, let&rsquo;s have a look at how our field coefficents
</p>
<p>a(k) and a&dagger;(k) act on something abstract and by doing this, we learn
</p>
<p>how the fields act on something abstract. To get some intuition about
</p>
<p>what is going on here, let&rsquo;s first have a look at something we are
</p>
<p>familiar with: energy.
</p>
<p>The energy E of a scalar field is given by66 We derived this in Eq. 4.40 from
time-translation invariance.

<p>(
(&part;0Φ)
</p>
<p>2 + (&part;iΦ)
2 + m2Φ2
</p>
<p>)
(9.10)
</p>
<p>By substituting Eq. 9.6 into Eq. 9.10 and using the commutation
</p>
<p>relations (Eq. 9.7-9.9), we can write
</p>
<p>E =
1

<p>)
(9.11)
</p>
<p>At this point we can see that our theory explodes. The second
</p>
<p>term in the integral is infinite. We could stop at this point and say
</p>
<p>that this kind of theory does not work. Nevertheless, some brave
</p>
<p>physicists dug deeper, ignoring this infinite term and discovered a
</p>
<p>theory describing nature very accurately. There is no explanation for
</p>
<p>this and the standard way of continuing from here on is to ignore the
</p>
<p>second term. The crux here is that this term appears in the energy
</p>
<p>of every system and we are only able to measure energy differences.
</p>
<p>Therefore, this constant infinite term appears in none of our measure-

</p>
<p>This suggests how we should interpret what the field does. Imag-

<p>ine a completely empty system |0〉, with, by definition H |0〉 = 0 |0〉.

Using Eq. 9.16
</p>
<p>ωk&prime; a

</p>
<p>We see that a&dagger;(k&prime;) creates something in the completely empty system
with energy ωk&prime; , which is what we call a particle with momentum
</p>
<p>k&prime;! If we act a second time on this system with a&dagger;(k&prime;) we create a
second particle with the same momentum. If we act on it with a&dagger;(k&prime;&prime;)
we create a particle with momentum k&prime;&prime; and so on. Therefore, we
call a&dagger;(k&prime;) a creation operator. Similarly to a&dagger;(k&prime;), we can interpret
a(k&prime;): a(k&prime;) destroys or annihilates a particle of energy ωk&prime; and is
therefore called annihilation or destruction operator. To make this
</p>
<p>more concrete we introduce a new notation for particle states
</p>
<p>a&dagger;(k) |0〉 &equiv; |1k〉 (9.18)
a&dagger;(k) |1k〉 &equiv; |2k〉 (9.19)
</p>
<p>a&dagger;(k&prime;) |2k〉 &equiv; |2k, 1k&prime;〉 (9.20)
</p>
<p>Take a look at the energy again:

<p>E =

</p>
<p>&dagger;(k)a(k) .
</p>
<p>What happens if this operator acts on a state like |2k1, k2〉? The result
should be
</p>
<p>E = 2ωk1 +ωk2 ,
</p>
<p>which is the energy of two particles with energy ωk1 and one particle
</p>
<p>with energy ωk2 . Therefore, the operator
</p>
<p>N(k) &equiv; a&dagger;(k)a(k) (9.21)
</p>
<p>appearing here is a number operator, denoted N(k) that extracts the
</p>
<p>number of particles with momentum k from a state:
</p>
<p>N(k) |nk, n&prime;k, . . .〉 = nk |nk, n&prime;k, . . .〉 (9.22)

</p>
<p>Furthermore, take note that there are physical systems, where the
</p>
<p>momentum spectrum is not continuous, but discrete11. For such 11 Remember the particle in a box
example. It is an often used trick in
quantum field theory to assume the
system in question is restricted to a
volume V. This results in a discrete
momentum spectrum. At the end of the
computation the limit limV&rarr;&infin; is taken.

<p>of the form

<p>ωk N(k)
</p>
<p>and the commutation relation changes to

<p>[a(k), a&dagger;(k&prime;)] = δk,k&prime; . (9.23)
</p>
<p>Take note that quantum field theory is, like quantum mechanics, a
</p>
<p>theory making probabilistic predictions. Therefore, our states need to
</p>
<p>be normalized 〈k, k&prime;, ..|k, k&prime;, ..〉 != 1, because a probability of more than
100% = 1 doesn&rsquo;t make sense. If we act with an operator like a(k) on

<p>a ket, the new ket does not necessarily have unit norm12. Therefore, 12 Exactly the same line of though
was discussed in Section 3.6.1, where
we derived the finite-dimensional
su(2) representations. There, we also
introduced "ladder operators" J&plusmn; and
derived the constants that we emerge
when we act with these operators on a
given vector.

<p>we write

<p>Two questions may pop up at this point.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>216 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>1. What happens if we want to annihilate a particle in a completely
</p>
<p>empty system?
</p>
<p>2. What about energy or charge conservation? How can we create
</p>
<p>something from nothing without violating conservation laws?
</p>
<p>The conservation laws are, of course, never violated, but how this
</p>
<p>comes about will only become clear when we develop the theory
</p>
<p>further. Maybe it helps to see that at this point Richard Feynman had
</p>
<p>the same problem1414 Feynman&rsquo;s Nobel Lecture (December
11, 1965)
</p>
<p>I remember that when someone had started to teach me about creation
</p>
<p>and annihilation operators, that this operator creates an electron, I said,
</p>
<p>"how do you create an electron? It disagrees with the conservation
</p>
<p>of charge", and in that way, I blocked my mind from learning a very
</p>
<p>practical scheme of calculation.
</p>
<p>Secondly, we are never able to destroy something which is not
</p>
<p>there in the first place. If we act with the destruction operator a(k) on
</p>
<p>a completely empty state |0〉 we get, using Eq. 9.30
</p>
<p>a(k) |0k〉 =
&radic;
0 |0k &minus; 1k〉 = 0 (9.31)
</p>
<p>or equally
</p>
<p>a(k&prime;) |1k〉 =
&radic;
0 |1k, 0k&prime; &minus; 1k&prime;〉 = 0. (9.32)
</p>
<p>We can see that if we act with an annihilation operator a(k&prime;) on a
ket, like |k〉 that does not include a particle with this momentum k&prime;,
the theory produces a zero. The creation and annihilation operators
</p>
<p>appear in the Fourier expansion of the fields, which includes an
</p>
<p>integral (or sum) over all possible momenta. Therefore, if these fields
</p>
<p>act on a ket like |k〉, only one annihilation operator will result in
something non-zero. This will be of great importance when we try to
</p>
<p>describe interactions using quantum field theory.
</p>
<p>Before we move on to interactions, we take a brief look at free spin
1
2 and spin 1 fields.
</p>
<p>9.3 Free Spin 12 Field Theory
</p>
<p>The equation of motion for free spin 12 fields is the Dirac equation
1515 We derived the Dirac equation in
</p>
<p>Section 6.3.
</p>
<p>(iγμ&part;
μ &minus; m)Ψ = 0 .
</p>
<p>The general solution of the Dirac equation can be written in the
</p>
<p>form1616 The Dirac equation is solved in
Section 8.9. The general solution is then
written analogous to the solution of the
Klein-Gordon equation, discussed in
the last section.</p>

</p>
<p>but this time we do not restrict to real fields, because we saw in Sec-
</p>
<p>tion 6.3 that a Lorentz invariant Lagrangian needs complex spin 12
fields. In addition, we follow the standard convention and write the
</p>
<p>solutions as
</p>
<p>Ψ = &sum;

</p>
<p>&minus;ipx + d&dagger;r (p)vr(p)e
+ipx
</p>
<p>)
, (9.34)
</p>
<p>because in this way, d&dagger;r (p) can be seen to create an anti-particle. If
</p>
<p>we would name it dr(p) in the solution, this could lead to confusion,
</p>
<p>because for particles c&dagger;r (p) creates and cr(p) annihilates. Naming
</p>
<p>the Fourier coefficient d&dagger;r (p) instead of dr(p), leads to an analogous
</p>
<p>interpretation for anti-particles: d&dagger;r (p) creates and dr(p) annihilates.
</p>
<p>Analogously, we have for the adjoint Dirac equation
</p>
<p>(i&part;μΨ̄γμ + mΨ̄) = 0,
</p>
<p>which was also derived in Section 6.3, the solution

</p>
<p>The rest of the theory for free spin 12 fields can be developed simi-
</p>
<p>larly to the scalar theory, but there is one small difference18. Let&rsquo;s try 18 With incredible huge consequences!
In fact, nothing in this universe would
be stable if the spin 12 theory would
work exactly like the scalar theory.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>218 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>what we get when we use the formula
</p>
<p>[Ψ(x),π(y)] = iδ(x &minus; y) (9.38)
</p>
<p>for spin 12 fields, too. In the general solution for the equation of mo-
</p>
<p>tion, i.e. the Dirac equation, we have two different coefficients: c&dagger;
</p>
<p>creates particles, whereas d&dagger; creates anti-particles. When we now
</p>
<p>compute the Hamiltonian for a spin 12 field, using the commutation
</p>
<p>relation19, we get something of the form19 [Ψ(x),π(y)]
= Ψ(x)π(y)&minus; π(y)Ψ(x) = iδ(x &minus; y)
</p>
<p>H &sim;
&int;
</p>
<p>c&dagger;c &minus; d&dagger;d .
</p>
<p>This shows that the energy of anti-particles is then negative. This is a
</p>
<p>serious problem because every state could forever decay to lower en-
</p>
<p>ergy states and nothing in this universe would be stable. The Hamil-
</p>
<p>tonian is not bounded from below, in contrast to the scalar case.
</p>
<p>However, when we use instead the anticommutation relation
</p>
<p>{Ψ(x),π(y)} = Ψ(x)π(y) + π(y)Ψ(x) = &minus;iδ(x &minus; y),
</p>
<p>the term involving the anti-particle creation and annihilation opera-
</p>
<p>tors comes out positive and the problem is therefore solved.
</p>
<p>This has very interesting consequences. For example, we then
</p>
<p>have2020 Analogous to Eq. 9.9 for scalars, but
now with the anticommutator instead
of the commutator [, ] &rarr; {, }. {c
</p>
<p>&dagger;(p), c&dagger;(p&prime;)} = 0
</p>
<p>from which we can conclude
</p>
<p>{c&dagger;(p), c&dagger;(p)} = c&dagger;(p)c&dagger;(p) + c&dagger;(p)c&dagger;(p) = 2c&dagger;(p)c&dagger;(p) = 0.
</p>
<p>&rArr; c&dagger;(p)c&dagger;(p) = 0 (9.39)
</p>
<p>The action of two equal creation operators21always results in a21 For spin 0 fields the correspond-
ing equation isn&rsquo;t very surpris-
ing, because there we use the
commutator: [c&dagger;(p), c&dagger;(p)] =
c&dagger;(p)c&dagger;(p)&minus; c&dagger;(p)c&dagger;(p) = 0 .
</p>
<p>zero! This means we cannot create two equal spin 12 particles and this
</p>
<p>is famously called Pauli-exclusion principle.
</p>
<p>The other anti-commutation relations for the Fourier coefficients
</p>
<p>can be derived from the anti-commutator of the field and the conju-
</p>
<p>gate momentum to be:
</p>
<p>{cr(p), c&dagger;s (p&prime;)} = δrsδ(p&minus; p&prime;) {dr(p), d&dagger;s (p&prime;)} = δrsδ(p&minus; p&prime;) (9.40)
</p>
<p>and all other possible combinations equal zero. Therefore, these coef-
</p>
<p>ficients can be seen to have the same properties as those we derived
</p>
<p>in the last section for the spin 0 field. They create and destroy, with</p>

</p>
<p>the difference that acting twice with the same operator on a state re-
</p>

<p>choose to ignore this.
</p>
<p>9.4 Free Spin 1 Field Theory
</p>

</p>
<p>Proca equation22 22 We derived the Proca equation in
Section 6.4.

&part;σ(&part;

<p>Aμ =

</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>&equiv; A+μ + A&minus;μ (9.44)
</p>
<p>where ǫr,μ(k) are basis vectors, called polarization vectors. For spin
</p>
<p>1 fields we are again able to use the commutator instead of the anti-
</p>
<p>commutator. We are therefore able to derive that the coefficients ar, a
&dagger;
r
</p>
<p>have the same properties as the coefficients for spin 0 fields.
</p>
<p>9.5 Interacting Field Theory
</p>
<p>The next step is to look at interactions between fields of different
</p>
<p>spin. The corresponding Lagrangians were derived in earlier chapters
</p>
<p>from Lorentz and gauge symmetry. For example, for the interaction
</p>
<p>between a massive spin 12 field and one massless spin 1 field, we have
</p>
<p>the Lagrangian (Eq. 7.17)
</p>
<p>LDirac+Extra-Term = &minus;mΨ̄Ψ + iΨ̄γμ&part;μΨ + gAμΨ̄γμΨ (9.45)
</p>
<p>from which we derive the corresponding Hamiltonian23 23 We will use this Hamiltonian in a
moment!</p>

<p>9.5.1 Scatter Amplitudes
</p>
<p>One of the main goals in quantum field theory is to compute the
</p>
<p>probability for a fixed number n of particles with defined24 momenta24 This is what physicists prepare in
collider experiments. p1, p2, .., pn to transform into a (possibly different) number of (pos-
</p>
<p>sibly different) particles n&prime; with momenta q1, q2, .., qn&prime; . We can write
this using Dirac&rsquo;s notation
</p>
<p>〈q1, q2, .., qn&prime; | Ŝ |p1, p2, .., pn〉 , (9.47)
</p>
<p>where Ŝ is the operator describing the scattering. We will derive
</p>
<p>how this operator looks concretely in the next section. Formulated
</p>
<p>differently, we have some particles at initial time ti at some points in
</p>
<p>space xi and after the interaction, i.e. at the final time t f , (possibly
</p>
<p>different) particles at a possibly different location x f .
</p>
<p>Therefore, the first question we have to answer is: What can we
</p>
<p>say about the time evolution of states in quantum field theory?
</p>
<p>9.5.2 Time Evolution of States
</p>
<p>To answer this question we observe that the energy operator is given
</p>
<p>on the one hand by the identification with the generator of time-
</p>
<p>translations i&part;0 and on the other hand by the Hamiltonian. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, for the free spin 0 theory we derived (Eq. 9.10)
</p>
<p>H0free =

</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>&int;
d3x
</p>
<p>(
(&part;0Φ)
</p>
<p>2 + (&part;iΦ)
2 + mΦ2
</p>
<p>)
, (9.48)
</p>
<p>while for the free spin 12 theory we have (Eq. 9.41)
</p>
<p>H
1

free =
</p>
<p>&int;
d3x(mΨ̄Ψ + iΨ̄γi&part;

<p>iΨ). (9.49)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>quantum field theory 221
</p>
<p>Both identifications are operators in a field theory, representing en-
</p>
<p>ergy, and we therefore write
</p>
<p>i&part;0 |?(t)〉 = H |?(t)〉 , (9.50)
</p>
<p>which is the equation governing the time evolution of a state in quan-
</p>
<p>tum field theory. We can use this equation to define a time-evolution
</p>
<p>operator U that transforms the state from one point in time to an-
</p>
<p>other. If we choose, for brevity, the start time t = 0 we have25 25 In general |?(t)〉 = U(t &minus; t&prime;) |?(t&prime;)〉.
</p>
<p>|?(t)〉 = U(t) |?(0)〉 . (9.51)
</p>
<p>Putting this ansatz into Eq. 9.50 yields
</p>
<p>i&part;0U(t) |?(0)〉 = HU(t) |?(0)〉 . (9.52)
</p>
<p>This equation holds for arbitrary |?(0)〉 and therefore
</p>
<p>i&part;0U(t) = HU(t). (9.53)
</p>
<p>The general solution of this equation is
</p>
<p>U(t) = e&minus;i
&int; t
0 dx0H (9.54)
</p>
<p>as we can check
</p>
<p>i&part;0U(t) = HU(t) &rarr; i&part;0e&minus;i
&int; t
0 dx0H = He&minus;i
</p>
<p>&int; t

<p>&rarr; i(&minus;iH)e&minus;i

</p>
<p>&rarr; He&minus;i
&int; t
0 dx0H = He&minus;i
</p>
<p>&int; t
0 dx0H � (9.55)
</p>
<p>In experiments we never measure a ket |?(t)〉, but always the com-
binations of a bra with a ket. In general, we have objects of the form
</p>
<p>〈 f (t)| Ô |i(t)〉 , (9.56)
</p>
<p>with some operator Ô, initial state |i(t)〉 and final state 〈 f (t)|. Here
the states evolve in time, as described by the operator U, and the
</p>
<p>operators are time independent. This somewhat arbitrary choice is
</p>
<p>called Schr&ouml;dinger picture and in the following we will talk about
</p>
<p>different possible choices, i.e. different "pictures".
</p>
<p>Writing Eq. 9.56 in terms of the time-evolution operator leads us
</p>
<p>to26 26 Remember 〈 f | = | f 〉&dagger;
</p>
<p>〈 f (0)|U&dagger;(t)ÔU(t) |i(0)〉 . (9.57)
</p>
<p>An important idea is that we can switch our perspective and say the
</p>
<p>operator Ô evolves in time, according to the rule U&dagger;(t)ÔU(t) and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>222 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>the bra and ket are time-independent. This new perspective is called
</p>
<p>Heisenberg picture.
</p>
<p>There is a similar, very useful trick that is helpful in interaction
</p>
<p>theory. The Hamiltonian is always the sum of the free Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>and the interaction Hamiltonian (Eq. 9.46)
</p>
<p>H = Hfree + HI . (9.58)
</p>
<p>The trick is to use a mixture of the two perspectives introduced
</p>
<p>above. We let the states evolve according to HI and the operators
2727 Recall that in quantum field theory
</p>
<p>the fields are our operators. according to Hfree. This is incredibly useful, because then we can
</p>
<p>reuse all results we already derived for free fields. This type of per-
</p>
<p>spective is called interaction picture. We define a state in the interac-
</p>
<p>tion picture
</p>
<p>|i(t)〉I &equiv; U&dagger;free |i(t)〉S , (9.59)
</p>
<p>where Ufree = e
&minus;i
</p>
<p>&int; t
0 dx0Hfree and the index S stands for Schr&ouml;dinger
</p>
<p>picture, which is the name for the standard perspective where the
</p>
<p>states evolve according to the full Hamiltonian and the operators are
</p>
<p>time-independent.
</p>
<p>Putting now Eq. 9.59 into Eq. 9.50 we get28 the time-evolution28 The equation holds in this form for
the Schr&ouml;dinger picture. Therefore, we
have to solve |i(t)〉I &equiv; U&dagger;free |i(t)〉S for
|i(t)〉S. We multiply the equation with
Ufree and use UfreeU
</p>
<p>&dagger;
free = 1. This yields
</p>
<p>|i(t)〉S = Ufree |i(t)〉I , which we can then
put into Eq. 9.50.
</p>

We conclude that the time-evolution of the states is now indeed
</p>
<p>governed by the interaction Hamiltonian HintI . This little equation
</p>
<p>will be incredibly important for everything that follows.
</p>
<p>Now we are able to return to the starting question: How can we
</p>
<p>compute scattering processes
</p>
<p>〈 f (t f )| Ŝ(t f , ti) |i(ti)〉 ? (9.61)</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>quantum field theory 223
</p>
<p>The operator Ŝ(t f , ti) transforms the initial state |i(ti)〉 at time ti into
the final state |Ψ(t f )〉 at time (t f ). In general, the final state is not
one specific particle state, but a linear combination of many possible
</p>
<p>outcomes. If this would be not the case particle physics would be
</p>
<p>boring. An interaction would always result in one specific outcome.
</p>
<p>We are more general here and allow arbitrary linear combinations.
</p>
<p>After we specify the operator Ŝ we will see that this is actually the
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>Concretely this means that Ŝ transforms an initial state into a
</p>
<p>linear combination of final states. To avoid confusion we will call the
</p>
<p>final time in the following simply t instead of t f . Then we have
29 29 This can be seen as a series expansion
</p>
<p>of the state |Ψ(t)〉 in terms of our
particle states | f (t)〉.Ŝ(t, ti) |i(ti)〉 = |Ψ(t)〉 = &sum;

</p>
<p>| f (t)〉 . (9.62)
</p>
<p>The multiplication with one specific 〈 f &prime;(t)| from the left-hand side
terminates all but one term of the sum:
</p>
<p>〈 f &prime;(t)|&sum;
f
</p>
<p>S f i | f (t)〉 = &sum;
f
</p>
<p>S f i 〈 f &prime;(t)| f (t)〉︸ ︷︷ ︸
=δ f f &prime; because basis states are orthogonal
</p>
<p>= &sum;
f
</p>
<p>S f iδ f f &prime; = S f &prime;i. (9.63)
</p>
<p>Therefore, the probability for this process to happen is |S f &prime;i|2.
</p>
<p>Now we specify the scatter operator Ŝ. For this purpose we take a
</p>
<p>look again at the time-evolution equation that we derived above30 30 Eq. 9.60 and in order to avoid nota-
tional clutter we suppress the super-
script "int", which denotes that we are
working in the interaction picture here.i&part;t |Ψ(t)〉I = HI |Ψ(t)〉I . (9.64)
</p>
<p>We can rewrite this in terms of our initial state and the operator Ŝ
</p>
<p>using Eq. 9.62

</p>
<p>= HI Ŝ |i(ti)〉I .
</p>
<p>Now using that this equation holds for arbitrary initial states we can
</p>
<p>write
</p>
<p>i&part;tŜ(t, ti) = HI Ŝ (9.65)
</p>
<p>with the general solution31 31 We omitted something very important
here, called time ordering, which we

</p>
<p>At a first glance the problem is easy now. We know HI and "just
</p>
<p>have to solve the integral". This gives the operator Ŝ(t, ti) and by
</p>
<p>acting with it on our initial states we get the probability amplitudes
</p>
<p>for different processes. Unfortunately, the integral cannot be solved</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>224 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>and we therefore have to use an approximation method. To simplify
</p>
<p>the problem mathematically, the initial time is taken to be ti = &minus;&infin;
and the final time t = &infin;. By doing this we avoid our probability
</p>
<p>amplitudes depending on time. For example, if we scatter particles,
</p>
<p>the probability that a certain process has happened 10&minus;24 seconds
after the assumed "collision" is different than 2 &middot; 10&minus;24 seconds after
the "collision", because the interaction is still happening! By taking
</p>
<p>the time values to be very large we avoid these kind of complications.
</p>
<p>What we measure is usually always a result after all the interactions
</p>
<p>have happened.
</p>
<p>9.5.3 Dyson Series
</p>
<p>Because there is no analytic solution for the exponentiated integral,
</p>
<p>we expand it in a Taylor series3232 This is derived in Appendix B.4.1:
ex = 1+ x + x

<p>)(&int; &infin;
&minus;&infin;
</p>
<p>dt2HI(t2)
</p>
<p>)
+ ... (9.67)
</p>
<p>This is called the Dyson series. We need to take a careful look at
</p>
<p>the third term. HI(t1) and HI(t2) are not just numeric values, but
</p>
<p>operators acting on a ket to their right. Therefore, we need to make
</p>
<p>sure that the earlier time operator acts on the ket before the later time
</p>
<p>operator. The operators need to operate on the ket in a time ordered
</p>
<p>manner. It makes no sense if we act on a state with HI(t = 5 s) and
</p>
<p>after that with HI(t = 2 s). In the series above, we need for t1 &lt; t2
</p>
<p>(&int; &infin;
&minus;&infin;
</p>
<p>dt2HI(t2)
</p>
<p>)(&int; &infin;

</p>

</p>
<p>For this purpose an abstract time-ordering operator T is introduced,
</p>
<p>which is defined by
</p>
<p>T {A(x)B(y)} := A(t1)B(t2) if t1 &gt; t2
B(t2)A(t1) if t1 &lt; t2.

<p>pling constant of the corresponding interaction, i.e. HI &prop; g . This
</p>
<p>coupling constant is, for example, for electromagnetic interactions,
</p>
<p>smaller than one. Therefore, the second term in the expansion S(2) &prop;
</p>
<p>(HI)
2 &prop; g2 contributes less than the first term S(1) &prop; g. The higher or-
</p>
<p>der terms in the expansion contribute even less: g &gt; g2 &gt; g3 &gt; . . .. To
</p>
<p>describe the system in question it often suffices to evaluate the first
</p>
<p>few terms of the series expansion. Higher order terms often deliver
</p>
<p>corrections that lie outside the possibility of measurement.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, going further from this point needs many pages of
</p>
<p>heavy algebra. The first step is Wick&rsquo;s-Theorem which enables one
</p>
<p>to express the time ordering in terms of commutators. Furthermore,
</p>
<p>these commutators need to be computed, which results in the famous
</p>
<p>Feynman propagators. Nevertheless, we want to go further34, so we 34 Because now, the fun is about to
begin!are going to use these results without proofs. The interested reader is
</p>
<p>referred to the standard texts on quantum field theory35. 35 Some recommended books will be
listed in the last section of this chapter.
</p>
<p>9.5.4 Evaluating the Series
</p>
<p>We will now return to the example introduced at the beginning of
</p>
<p>this chapter: The interaction between a massive spin 12 field and a
</p>
<p>massless spin 0 field. The corresponding interaction Hamiltonian is
</p>
<p>(Eq. 9.46)
</p>
<p>HI = &minus;
&int;
</p>
<p>d3xgAμΨ̄γ
μΨ.
</p>
<p>As explained above, we will look at each term of the series in Eq. 9.70
</p>
<p>individually.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>226 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>The first term of the series is trivial as it is simply the identity
</p>
<p>operator
</p>
<p>S(0) = I (9.71)
</p>
<p>The second term is more exciting:
</p>
<p>S(1) = &minus;i
&int; &infin;
</p>
<p>&minus;&infin;
dtHI = ig
</p>
<p>&int; &infin;
</p>
<p>&minus;&infin;
d4xAμΨ̄γ
</p>
<p>μΨ (9.72)
</p>
<p>which we rewrite, recalling Eq. 9.33 and Eq. 9.44, as
</p>
<p>S(1) = ig
&int; &infin;
</p>
<p>&minus;&infin;
d4x(A+μ + A
</p>
<p>&minus;
μ )(Ψ̄
</p>
<p>+ + Ψ̄&minus;)γμ(Ψ+ + Ψ&minus;). (9.73)
</p>
<p>We can see this second term is actually 8 terms. Let us have a look at
</p>
<p>how one of these terms, we call it S
(1)
1 , acts on a state consisting of,
</p>
<p>for example, one electron and one positron with prepared momenta
</p>
<p>|e+(p1), e&minus;(p2)〉
</p>
<p>ig
&int; &infin;
</p>
<p>&minus;&infin;
d4xA+μ Ψ̄
</p>
<p>+γμΨ+ |e+(p1), e&minus;(p2)〉 .
</p>
<p>Ψ+ consists of destruction36 operators for particles for all37 possible36 Remember the operators with the &dagger;
are those who create and the operators
without are those who destroy. Ψ+ is
defined in Eq. 9.33.
</p>
<p>37 We integrate over all possible mo-
menta!
</p>
<p>momenta, multiplied with constants and a term of the form e&minus;ipx1 :
</p>
<p>Ψ+ &prop;
</p>
<p>&int;
d3p cr(p)e
</p>
<p>&minus;ipx .
</p>
<p>For each momentum this destroys the ket, which means we get a
</p>
<p>zero, because we are trying to destroy something which is not there,
</p>
<p>except for cr(p) = cr(p2). Therefore, operating with Ψ
+ results in
</p>
<p>Ψ+ |e+(p1), e&minus;(p2)〉 &prop; e&minus;ip2x |e+, 0〉
</p>
<p>In the same way, operating with Ψ̄+ on the ket results in
</p>
<p>Ψ̄+e&minus;ip2x |e+(p1), 0〉 &prop; e&minus;ip2xe&minus;ip1x |0, 0〉 .
</p>
<p>Therefore, we are left with the pure vacuum state, multiplied with
</p>
<p>lots of constants. The last term operating on the ket is A+μ , which
</p>
<p>creates photons of all momenta.

<p>able to measure or prepare a system in one defined momentum, but
</p>
<p>only in a range. Therefore, at the end of our computation, we have to
</p>
<p>integrate over the relevant momentum range.
</p>
<p>Take note that the seven other terms contributing to Ŝ(1) result
</p>
<p>in a zero, because they destroy for example, a photon, which is not
</p>
<p>there in the beginning. If we had started with particles other than an
</p>
<p>electron and a positron, for example, a photon and a positron |γ, e+〉,
the first term results in a zero and some other term is non-zero.
</p>
<p>Next we take a very quick, qualitative look at the third term of Ŝ:

,
</p>
<p>(9.75)
</p>
<p>where the time-ordering can be rewritten using Wick&rsquo;s Theorem into
</p>
<p>a sum of normal-ordered, denoted N{}, terms with commutators in
it. Normal ordering means, putting all creation operators to the left,
</p>
<p>and all annihilation operators to the right. For instance, N{aa&dagger;a&dagger;a} =
a&dagger;a&dagger;aa. One of the terms of this sum, for example, is

</p>
<p>where the computation of the commutator can be done using the
</p>
<p>explicit solution for Aμ and the result is called Photon propagator
39 39 The propagators are one of the most
</p>
<p>complicated things to derive in quan-
tum field theory. For instance, consid-
ering the scalar propagator, the starting
point is i∆ &equiv; 〈0| T{Φ(x)Φ&dagger;(y)} |0〉,
which creates a particle from the vac-
uum at y and destroys it again at x.
This can be rewritten as the commu-
tator i∆ = 〈0| [Φ+&dagger;(y),Φ&minus;(x)] |0〉
and after many pages of math
we get an expression of the form
</p>
<p>i∆ = &minus;i
2π3
</p>
<p>&int;
d3k
ωk
</p>
<p>e&minus;ik(x&minus;y). This final
expression is what we can use in com-
putations. This is just a sketch and
many things here are not completely
correct. Nevertheless it should give you
a rough idea of what is going on.
</p>
<p>[Aμ(x1), Aμ(x2)] &equiv; iDμ(x1 &minus; x2) .
</p>
<p>From this term we get again many, many terms, because every
</p>
<p>Ψ, Ψ̄ etc. is actually a sum of two terms, and we will take a look at
</p>
<p>just one of them. Therefore, qualitatively we have for one40 of these
</p>
<p>40 We pick again the term not resulting
in a zero for the collision of an electron
with a positron.

</p>
<p>This can be understood physically:
</p>
<p>&bull; The two particles we start with are destroyed at x2 by Ψ̄
+(x2)Ψ
</p>
<p>+(x2).
</p>
<p>&bull; Then the propagator creates a "virtual" photon at x2 and propa-
</p>
<p>gates it to x1 where it is destroyed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Finally Ψ̄&minus;(x1)Ψ&minus;(x1) again create at x1 an electron and a positron.

momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles can be completely
</p>
<p>different, but not their sum41. In the same way, all the other terms41 This must be the case, because we
have conservation of momentum. can be interpreted as some reaction between massive42 spin 12 and

<p>The probability amplitudes we get from computations like this
</p>
<p>can then be directly checked in experiments, because the probability
</p>
<p>amplitude is directly connected to a quantity that can be measured in
</p>
<p>experiments: the cross section.
</p>
<p>The techniques outlined in this chapter can be used to derive
</p>
<p>many important results of quantum field theory. The other inter-
</p>
<p>action terms we derived can be put into the interaction Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>and the corresponding probability amplitudes follow analogously.
</p>
<p>Take not that the method we discussed here, only works if the cou-
</p>
<p>pling constant is smaller than 1. If the coupling constant is bigger
</p>
<p>than 1, higher order terms in the sum in Eq. 9.70 are bigger than
</p>
<p>lower order terms and therefore it is by no means justified to use just
</p>
<p>the first terms of the series, to get an approximation.

<p>9.6 Appendix: Most General Solution of the
</p>
<p>Klein-Gordon Equation
</p>
<p>It is not too hard to find one solution of the Klein-Gordon equation.
</p>
<p>Certainly plane waves
</p>
<p>Φ(x) = aei(px&minus;Et) = ae&minus;i(pμx
μ)
</p>
<p>do the job, because of the energy-momentum relation of special rela-
</p>
<p>tivity (Eq. 8.2)
</p>
<p>E2 = �p2 + m2 &rarr; pμpμ = m2
</p>
<p>as we can check:
</p>
<p>(&part;μ&part;
μ + m2)Φ = (&part;μ&part;
</p>
<p>μ + m2)e&minus;i(pμx
μ)
</p>
<p>= (&minus;pμpμ + m2)e&minus;i(pμx
μ)
</p>
<p>= (&minus;m2 + m2)e&minus;i(pμxμ)
</p>
<p>= 0 � (9.77)
</p>
<p>Because we differentiate the field twice the sign in the exponent does
</p>
<p>not matter. Equally
</p>
<p>Φ&dagger;(x) = a&dagger;e&minus;i(px&minus;Et) = a&dagger;ei(pμx
μ)
</p>
<p>is a solution. Further solutions can be built as linear combinations.
</p>
<p>A general solution is given by superposition of all possible solutions,
</p>
<p>which can be seen as Fourier expansion50 50 That&rsquo;s were the factors of 2π come
from. Another way of seeing this is
demanding the solutions to form an
</p>
<p>orthonormal set:
&int;
</p>
<p>dkeikxe&minus;ikx
&prime;
=&int;
</p>
<p>dkeik(x&minus;x
&prime;) = 2πδ(x &minus; x&prime;). Therefore,
</p>
<p>the factors of 2π are normalisation
constants.
</p>
<p>Φ(x) =
&int;
</p>
<p>dp4
</p>
<p>(2π)4
(a(p)e&minus;i(pμx
</p>
<p>μ) + a&dagger;(p)ei(pμx
μ))
</p>
<p>Take note that we wrote a = a(p) because we can have a different
</p>
<p>multiplication factor for each value of p and each term in the summa-
</p>
<p>tion is a solution on its own.
</p>
<p>In this context it is conventional to work with the wave number
</p>
<p>ki &equiv; pih̄ and the frequency k0 = w &equiv; Eh̄ instead of the energy and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>230 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>momentum. Because we work with h̄ = 1 we simply have to rename
</p>
<p>our variables to get the standard textbook expressions. Furthermore
</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s conventional to abbreviate kx &equiv; kμxμ. We therefore write
</p>
<p>Φ(x) =
&int;
</p>
<p>dk4
</p>
<p>(2π)4
</p>
<p>(
a(k)e&minus;i(kx) + a&dagger;(k)ei(kx)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>Take note that not all solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation are
</p>
<p>suited to describe nature, because we have the "mass-shell" condi-
</p>
<p>tion
</p>
<p>pμp
μ = kμk
</p>
<p>μ = m2 &rarr; k20 &minus; k2i
!
= m2 &rarr; k2 != m2. (9.78)
</p>
<p>Only solutions satisfying the mass-shell condition are in agreement
</p>
<p>with the relativistic energy-momentum relation (Eq. 8.2). We can
</p>
<p>build this condition into our equation, excluding all non-physical
</p>
<p>(off-shell) solutions with a delta distribution5151 This is explained in Appendix D.2.
</p>
<p>Φ(x)physical =
&int;
</p>
<p>dk4
</p>
<p>(2π)4
2πδ(k2 &minus; m2)
</p>
<p>(
a(k)e&minus;i(kx) + a&dagger;(k)ei(kx)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>Besides that, only positive energy solutions are physical, because as
</p>
<p>explained earlier, otherwise the energy would be unbounded from
</p>
<p>below and nothing would be stable. We can built this constraint on
</p>
<p>our solutions into the equation by using a Heaviside function θ(k0),
</p>
<p>being zero for k0 &lt; 0 and 1 for k0 &ge; 0. Our integral then reads

<p>Classical Mechanics
</p>
<p>In this chapter we want to explore the connection between quan-

<p>the expectation value for the momentum operator gives us exactly

<p>Newton&rsquo;s second law, which is one of the foundations of classical

<p>mechanics.

<p>In words this means that the time derivative (of the expectation

<p>value) of the momentum equals the (expectation value of the) nega-
</p>
<p>tive gradient of the potential, which is known as force. This is exactly
</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s second law1. This equation can be used to compute the1 Recall that we used this equation,
without a derivation, to illustrate the
conserved quantities following from
Noether&rsquo;s theorem in Section 4.5. Here
we deliver the derivation, as promised.

<p>trajectories of macroscopic objects. Historically the force laws were
</p>
<p>deduced phenomenologically from experiments. All forces acting on
</p>
<p>an object were added linearly on the right-hand side of the equation.
</p>
<p>By using the phenomenologically deduced momentum pmak = mv,
</p>
<p>we can write the left-hand side as ddt pmak =
d
dt mv, which equals for
</p>
<p>an object with constant mass m ddt v. The velocity is the time-derivative
</p>
<p>of the location2 and we therefore have2 In other words, the velocity v =

</p>
<p>This is the differential equation one must solve for x = x(t) to get the
</p>
<p>trajectory of the object in question. An example for such a classical
</p>
<p>force will be derived in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>10.1 Relativistic Mechanics
</p>
<p>Using the Lagrangian formalism, we can look at classical mechanics
</p>
<p>from quite a different perspective. We need an equation that de-
</p>
<p>scribes the motion of individual particles. As always in this book,
</p>
<p>we assume that we can derive the correct equation if we minimize
</p>
<p>something. We already discussed at the beginning of Chapter 4 that
</p>
<p>this something must be invariant under all Lorentz transformations,
</p>
<p>because otherwise we don&rsquo;t get the same equations of motion in all
</p>
<p>frames of reference.
</p>
<p>Luckily, we already know something that is invariant under all
</p>
<p>Lorentz transformations: the invariant of special relativity, which was
</p>
<p>derived in Section 2.1:
</p>
<p>(ds)2 = (cdτ)2 = (cdt)2 &minus; (dx)2 &minus; (dy)2 &minus; (dz)2, (10.4)
</p>
<p>where τ is the proper time as explained in Section 2.2. Equally the
</p>
<p>square root of this is invariant and therefore the simplest possible
</p>
<p>thing we can minimize is
</p>
<p>S =
&int;
</p>
<p>Cdτ (10.5)
</p>
<p>with some constant C and
</p>
<p>dτ =
1
</p>
<p>c
</p>
<p>&radic;
(cdt)2 &minus; (dx)2 &minus; (dy)2 &minus; (dz)2 . (10.6)
</p>
<p>The correct constant turns out to be C = &minus;mc2 and therefore we need
to minimize
</p>
<p>S = &minus;mc2
&int;
</p>
<p>dτ. (10.7)
</p>
<p>For brevity we will restrict the following discussion to one dimen-
</p>
<p>sion. Then we can write
</p>
<p>dτ =

<p>potential to the Lagrangian33 We add &minus;V(x) instead of V(x),

<p>It is instructive to have a look at the non-relativistic limit of the

<p>relativistic limit" means, we consider a situation where the particle

<p>moves slowly compared with the speed of light: ẋ ≪ c. We can then
use the Taylor formula for the Lagrangian44 See Appendix B.3</p>

<p>Electrodynamics

<p>We discovered in Section 7.1.6 that Jρ is a Noether current, i.e. &part;ρ J

be seen directly from the definition Fσρ = &part;σAρ &minus; &part;ρAσ , and has
therefore 6 independent components. Three are

<p>This is a standard relation for the multiplication of two ǫ with one coinciding index

<p>The standard way to label these components is
</p>
<p>&part;i A0 &minus; &part;0Ai &equiv; Ei (11.5)

<p>ǫijk&part;j Ak &equiv; &minus;Bi (11.6)

</p>
<p>We can use the connection between quantum and classical mechan-
</p>
<p>ics that we discovered in the last chapter (the Ehrenfest theorem), to
</p>
<p>derive the famous Lorentz force law. The starting point is the equa-
</p>
<p>tion describing a non-relativistic particle, without spin, in an external
</p>
<p>electromagnetic field, i.e. the Schr&ouml;dinger equation with coupling to
</p>
<p>an external electromagnetic field7 (Eq. 8.24): 7 This equation can be derived from the
Klein Gordon equation with coupling
to an external electromagnetic field,
which we derived from the Lagrangian
describing spin 0 particles which are
coupled to a massless spin 1 field, i.e.
the photon field. Therefore, the real
starting point is once more Lorentz and
gauge symmetry, which we used to
derive the corresponding Lagrangian.
We use here the notation A0 &equiv; Φ.

<p>11.3 Coulomb Potential
</p>
<p>We learned in Chapter 7 that our Lagrangians are invariant under
</p>
<p>internal transformations. We can use this freedom to simplify com-
</p>
<p>putations, i.e. we transform the field in question with an internal
</p>
<p>transformation such that the computation becomes especially simple.
</p>
<p>This is allowed because the physics we describe with the field and
</p>
<p>the transformed field are the same, as long as we stick to the gauge
</p>
<p>transformations that leave the Lagrangian invariant. An often used
</p>
<p>choice is gauging the photon field Aμ such that10 &part;μA
μ = 0. This is 10 It can be shown explicitly that there
</p>
<p>is such a gauge choice. Further details
can be found in the standard textbooks
about electrodynamics.
</p>
<p>called the Lorenz gauge. Using this gauge simplifies the inhomoge-
</p>
<p>neous Maxwell equations to
</p>
<p>&part;σ(&part;
σAρ &minus; &part;ρAσ) = &part;σ&part;σAρ = Jρ (11.22)
</p>
<p>We now have a look at the physical situation where a fixed, static
</p>
<p>charge is located in a spherically symmetric region around the origin
</p>
<p>of our coordinate system. We want to describe physics in the outside
</p>
<p>region, which means in the region without a source in it, i.e. Jρ = 0.
</p>
<p>Therefore the Maxwell equations are in this region
</p>
<p>&part;σ&part;
σAρ = &part;0&part;0A
</p>
<p>ρ &minus; &part;i&part;i Aρ = 0. (11.23)
</p>
<p>We now use that we are considering a static (&part;0A
ρ = 0), spherically
</p>
<p>symmetric system, by rewriting the equation using spherical coordi-
</p>
<p>nates11. Then we can neglect all terms12 but the term involving the &part;r 11 Instead of using x, y, z to deter-
mine the position of some objects,
it&rsquo;s possible to use two angels θ, φ
and the distance from the origin r.

<p>Then we have &part;i&part;i A

</p>
<p>Gravity
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the best theory of gravity we have does not fit into the pic-
</p>
<p>ture outlined in the rest of this book. This is one of the biggest problems of
</p>
<p>modern physics and the following paragraphs try to give you a first impres-
</p>
<p>sion.
</p>
<p>The modern theory of gravity is Einstein&rsquo;s general relativity.
</p>
<p>The fundamental idea is that gravity is a result of the curvature of
</p>
<p>spacetime. Mass and energy change the curvature of spacetime and
</p>
<p>in turn the changed curvature influences the movement of mass and
</p>
<p>energy. This interplay between energy and curvature is described by
</p>
<p>the famous Einstein equation
</p>
<p>Gμν = 8πGTμν. (12.1)
</p>
<p>On the left-hand side is the Einstein tensor Gμν, which describes
</p>
<p>the curvature and on the right-hand side is the energy-momentum
</p>
<p>tensor1 Tμν. G is the gravitation constant. 1 Recall that the energy-momentum
tensor is the quantity which is directly
related to translational symmetry
(Eq. 4.36).
</p>
<p>From the idea gravity = curvature of spacetime, the derivation
</p>
<p>of the Einstein equation is, from a modern point of view, relatively
</p>
<p>straightforward2. Firstly, one of the most important laws of physics 2 Einstein needed 100 years ago ca. 6
years for the derivation of the correct
equation. Today, with the power of
hindsight we are much faster.
</p>
<p>is the conservation of energy and momentum, which as we saw,
</p>
<p>follows directly when considering a homogeneous spacetime. In
</p>
<p>a homogeneous spacetime the laws of physics are invariant under
</p>
<p>translations in space and time and using Noether&rsquo;s theorem, we
</p>
<p>can derive the conservation of momentum and energy. Therefore,
</p>
<p>one of the most basic assumptions of physics is that spacetime is
</p>
<p>homogeneous and therefore energy and momentum are conserved.
</p>
<p>In mathematical terms this conservation law is expressed as (Eq. 4.36)
</p>
<p>&part;μTμν = 0. (12.2)

<p>246 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Next we need something to describe curvature mathematically.
</p>
<p>This is what makes general relativity computationally very demand-
</p>
<p>ing. Nevertheless, we already know the most important object: the
</p>
<p>metric. Recall that metrics are the mathematical objects that enable
</p>
<p>us to compute the distance between two points3. In a curved space3 Up to this point we only con-
sidered the Minkowski metric
</p>
<p>ημν =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎜⎝
</p>
<p>1 0 0 0
0 &minus;1 0 0
0 0 &minus;1 0
0 0 0 &minus;1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎟⎠ and
</p>
<p>the Euclidean metric δij =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎝
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎠
</p>
<p>the distance between two points is different than in a flat space as
</p>
<p>illustrated in Fig. 12.1. Therefore metrics will play a very important
</p>
<p>role when thinking about curvature in mathematical terms.
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.1: Distance between two points
in a curved and a flat space
</p>
<p>Having talked about this, we are ready to "derive" the Einstein
</p>
<p>equation, because it turns out that there is exactly one mathematical
</p>
<p>object that we can put on the left-hand side: the Einstein tensor Gμν.
</p>
<p>The Einstein tensor is the only divergence-free4 function of the metric
</p>
<p>4 &part;μGμν = 0
</p>
<p>gμν and at most its first and second partial derivative. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>Einstein tensor may be very complicated, but it&rsquo;s the only object we
</p>
<p>are allowed to write on the left-hand side describing curvature. This
</p>
<p>follows, because we can conclude from

<p>This can be quite intimidating and shows why computations in gen-

</p>
<p>Next we need to know how things react to such a curved space-
</p>
<p>time. What&rsquo;s the path of an object from A to B in curved spacetime?
</p>
<p>The first guess is the correct one: An object follows the shortest path
</p>
<p>between two points in curved spacetime. We can start with a given
</p>
<p>distribution of energy and mass, which means some Tμν, compute the
</p>
<p>metric or Christoffel symbols with the Einstein equation and then get</p>

</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Einstein thought about the Christoffel
</p>
<p>Symbols as the gravitational field
</p>
<p>If the Γ

νρ vanish, then the point moves uniformly in a straight line.
</p>
<p>These quantities therefore condition the deviation of the motion from
</p>
<p>uniformity. They are the components of the gravitational field.
</p>
<p>- Albert Einstein7 7 Albert Einstein. The foundation of the
general theory of relativity. 1916
</p>
<p>We can understand what Einstein means by looking at Eq. 12.7. For
</p>
<p>Γ
μ
νρ = 0 the geodesic equation reduces to
</p>
<p>d2xλ
</p>
<p>dt2
= 0. (12.8)
</p>
<p>The solutions of this equation describe a straight line.
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.2: In order to be able to compare
the red arrow with the black arrow, we
transport the black arrow to the location
of the red arrow.
</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of a curved spacetime is that the notion
</p>
<p>of differentiation changes. Remember how the derivative is defined
</p>
<p>in flat space using the difference quotient
</p>
<p>f &prime;(a) = lim
h&rarr;0
</p>
<p>f (a + h)&minus; f (a)
h
</p>
<p>. (12.9)
</p>
<p>This definition requires that we compare the function in question
</p>
<p>at two different points. In a curved space this comparison is not
</p>
<p>as trivial as in the flat space. Take a look at Fig. 12.2. If we want to
</p>
<p>compare two vectors on a sphere, how can we make sure that the
</p>
<p>vectors are really different and the difference is not just an effect of
</p>
<p>the curved space? The answer of differential geometry is parallel
</p>
<p>transport. We have to move one vector to the location of the other
</p>
<p>one, to be able to compare them8. 8 In fact in differential geometry one
has only local coordinate systems. The
defining feature of a manifold is that it
looks locally flat=Euclidean. This was
discussed in Section 3.11. Therefore,
the coefficients we use to describe the
objects in questions are only valid in a
small region of the manifold and thus
we can only compare coefficients of the
same coordinate system.
</p>
<p>The derivative becomes in a curved space the covariant deriva-
</p>
<p>tive9
</p>
<p>9 In this context the Christoffel symbols
Γabc are often called connection coef-
ficients, because of their property to
connect the points we want to compare.
</p>
<p>Dbv
a &equiv; &part;bva + Γabcvc. (12.10)
</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want any equation we derived so far to be valid in
</p>
<p>curved spacetime, we need to change
</p>
<p>&part;b &rarr; Db = &part;b + Γabc. (12.11)</p>

<p>248 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>Does this look familiar? Take a look again at Eq. 7.18. We learned in
</p>
<p>an earlier chapter that a locally U(1) invariant Lagrangian for spin 0
</p>
<p>or spin 12 fields required a specific coupling with a spin 1 field. This
</p>
<p>specific coupling can be summarized by the prescription
</p>
<p>&part;μ &rarr; Dμ &equiv; &part;μ + ieAμ. (12.12)
Remember that this wasn&rsquo;t just a mathematical gimmick. This pre-
</p>
<p>scription gives us the correct theory of electromagnetism. The same is
</p>
<p>true for weak

</p>
<p>&part;μ &rarr; Dμ = &part;μ &minus; ig&prime; Gμ︸︷︷︸

</p>
<p>. (12.14)
</p>
<p>Although things look quite similar here, there is for many reasons no
</p>
<p>formulation of gravity that is compatible with the quantum descrip-
</p>
<p>tion of all other forces. All other forces are described in a quantum
</p>
<p>theory and one can only make probability predictions. In contrast,
</p>
<p>general relativity is a classical theory, because particles follow de-
</p>
<p>fined trajectories and there is no need for probability predictions.
</p>
<p>To make things worse, at the current time no experiment can shine
</p>
<p>any light on the interplay between those forces. The effects of gravity
</p>
<p>on elementary particles is too weak to be measured. Because of this,
</p>
<p>the standard model, which ignores gravity entirely and only takes
</p>
<p>the weak, the strong and the electromagnetic interactions into ac-
</p>
<p>count, works very well. The effects of general relativity only become
</p>
<p>measurable with very heavy objects. For such quantum effects play
</p>
<p>no role, because massive objects consist of many, many elementary
</p>
<p>particles and all quantum effects get averaged out. We discovered in
</p>
<p>Chapter 10 that the equation of motion for the average value is just
</p>
<p>the classical one and no quantum effects are measurable. One can
</p>
<p>make a long list of things that make constructing a quantum theory
</p>
<p>of gravity so difficult, but Einstein formulated the difference between
</p>
<p>gravity and all other forces very concisely:
</p>
<p>...according to the general theory of relativity, gravitation occupies
</p>
<p>an exceptional position with regard to other forces, particularly the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic forces, since the ten functions representing the gravita-
</p>
<p>tional field at the same time define the metrical properties of the space
</p>
<p>measured.

</p>
<p>We are able do describe quantum particles in a curved space, by
</p>
<p>changing the derivative to the covariant derivative. But this is of
</p>
<p>course no dynamical theory of gravity. We could make the right-
</p>
<p>hand side of the Einstein equation quantum, if we make the usual
</p>
<p>identification with the corresponding generator, but what about
</p>
<p>the left-hand side? The Einstein tensor in terms of the Christoffel

<p>Thus maybe we can think of the Einstein equation as the field equa-

<p>Closing Words
</p>
<p>In my humble opinion we are a long way from a theory that is able
</p>
<p>to explain all the things that we would like. Even the beautiful theory
</p>
<p>we developed in the major part of this book still has many loose
</p>
<p>ends that need clarification. In addition, we still have no clue how to
</p>
<p>derive the correct quantum theory of gravity as discussed in the last
</p>
<p>chapter.
</p>
<p>Besides that there is experimental evidence, mostly from cosmol-
</p>
<p>ogy and astroparticle physics (Dark Matter and Dark Energy), which
</p>
<p>indicates that the present theories are not the end of the story.
</p>
<p>I personally think there is still much to come and maybe a com-
</p>
<p>pletely new framework is needed to overcome the present obstacles.
</p>
<p>Anyway, the future developments will be very interesting and I hope
</p>
<p>you will continue following the story and maybe contribute some-
</p>
<p>thing yourself.

<p>Vector calculus
</p>
<p>It is often useful in physics to describe the position of some object
</p>
<p>using three numbers
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>x
</p>
<p>y
</p>
<p>z
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠. This is what we call a vector �v and de-
</p>
<p>note by a little arrow above the letter. The three numbers are the
</p>
<p>components of the vector along the three coordinate axes. The first
</p>
<p>number tells us how far the vector in question goes in the x-direction,
</p>
<p>the second how far in the y-direction and the third how far in the
</p>
<p>z-direction. For example, �w =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
0
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ is a vector that points exclusively
</p>
<p>in the y-direction.
</p>
<p>Vectors can be added
</p>
<p>�v =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>vx
vy
vz
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ �w =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>wx
wy
wz
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ &rarr; �v + �w =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>vx + wx
vy + wy
vz + wy
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ (A.1)
</p>
<p>and multiplied
</p>
<p>�v &middot; �w =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>vx
vy
vz
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ &middot;
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>wx
wy
wz
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ = vxwx + vywy + vzwz. (A.2)
</p>
<p>The result of this multiplication is not a vector, but a number (= a
</p>
<p>scalar), hence the name: scalar product. The scalar product of a vec-
</p>
<p>tor with itself is directly related to its length:
</p>
<p>length(�v) =
&radic;
�v &middot;�v. (A.3)
</p>
<p>Take note that we can&rsquo;t simply write three quantities below each
</p>
<p>other between two brackets and expect it to be a vector. For example,

<p>256 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we put the temperature T, the pressure P and the humidity
</p>
<p>H of a room between two brackets:
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>T
</p>
<p>P
</p>
<p>H
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ . (A.4)
</p>
<p>Nothing prevents us from doing so, but the result would be rather
</p>
<p>pointless and definitely not a vector, because there is no linear con-
</p>
<p>nection between these quantities that could lead to the mixing of
</p>
<p>these quantities. In contrast, the three position coordinates transform
</p>
<p>into each other, for example if we look at the vector from a different
</p>
<p>perspective1. Therefore writing the coordinates below each other1 This will be made explicit in a mo-
ment. between two big brackets is useful. Another example would be the
</p>
<p>momentum of some object. Again, the components mix if we look at
</p>
<p>the object from a different perspective and therefore writing it like
</p>
<p>the position vector is useful.
</p>
<p>For the moment let&rsquo;s say a vector is a quantity that transforms
</p>
<p>exactly like the position vector �v. This means, if under some trans-
</p>
<p>formation we have �v &rarr; �v&prime; = M�v any quantity that transforms like
�w &rarr; �w&prime; = M�w is a vector. Examples are the momentum or accelera-
tion of some object.
</p>
<p>We will encounter this idea quite often in physics. If we write
</p>
<p>quantities below each other between two brackets, they aren&rsquo;t nec-
</p>
<p>essarily vectors, but the quantities can transform into each other
</p>
<p>through some linear operation. This is often expressed by multiplica-
</p>
<p>tion with a matrix.
</p>
<p>A.1 Basis Vectors
</p>
<p>We can make the idea of components along the coordinate axes more
</p>
<p>general by introducing basis vectors. Basis vectors are linearly inde-
</p>
<p>pendent2 vectors of length one. In three dimensions we need three2 A set of vectors {�a,�b,�c} is called
linearly independent if the equation
</p>
<p>c1�a + c2�b + c3�c = 0 is only true for
c1 = c2 = c3 = 0. This means that
no vector can be written as a linear
combination of the other vectors,
because if we have c1�a + c2�b + c3�c = 0
for numbers different than zero, we can
write c1�a + c2�b = &minus;c3�c.
</p>
<p>basis vectors and we can write every vector in terms of these basis
</p>
<p>vectors. An obvious choice is:
</p>
<p>�e1 =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ , �e2 =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝

</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ (A.5)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>vector calculus 257
</p>
<p>and an arbitrary three-dimensional vector �v can be expressed in
</p>
<p>terms of these basis vectors
</p>
<p>�v =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>v1

<p>⎞
⎟⎠ = v1�e1+ v2�e2+ v3�e3 = v1

</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝

</p>
<p>1

<p>0

<p>⎛

</p>
<p>The numbers v1, v2, v3 are called the components of �v. Take note that
</p>
<p>these components depend on the basis vectors.
</p>
<p>The vector �w we introduced above3 can therefore be written as
3 �w =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎝
0
4
0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎠
</p>
<p>�w = 0�e1 + 4�e2 + 0�e3. An equally good choice for the basis vectors
</p>
<p>would be
</p>
<p>�̃e1 =
1&radic;
2
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
1
</p>

<p>0

</p>
<p>1&radic;
2
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>&minus;1
0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ , �̃e3 =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
0
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ . (A.7)
</p>
<p>In this basis the vector �w "looks" quite different:
</p>
<p>�w = 2
&radic;
2�̃e1 &minus; 2
</p>
<p>&radic;
2�̃e2 + 0�̃e3 = 2
</p>
<p>&radic;
2
</p>
<p>1&radic;
2
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝

</p>
<p>1

<p>0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠&minus; 2
</p>
<p>&radic;

<p>⎛

⎟⎠ =
</p>
<p>⎛

⎟⎠ .
</p>
<p>(A.8)
</p>
<p>Therefore we can write �w in terms of components with respect to this

<p>new basis as

<p>�̃w =

<p>This is not a different vector just a different description! To be pre-
</p>
<p>cise, �̃w is the description of the vector �w in a coordinate system that is
</p>
<p>rotated relative to the coordinate system we used in the first place.
</p>
<p>A.2 Change of Coordinate Systems
</p>
<p>The connection between different coordinate systems can be made
</p>
<p>precise through the use of matrices. Two different coordinate systems
</p>
<p>can mean that we have two different observers that look at our exper-
</p>
<p>iment from different perspectives or this can simply mean that one
</p>
<p>observer decides to use a different set of basis vectors. How are those
</p>
<p>descriptions related? To avoid complications, let&rsquo;s assume that the
</p>
<p>origin of the two coordinate systems coincide and both coordinate
</p>
<p>systems have the same z-axes. Therefore only the x and y coordinates</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>258 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>are different. Let&rsquo;s assume further that the position of something
</p>
<p>important in the experiment is described by the vector �v.
</p>
<p>If the first observer sees the vector �v =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>vx
vy
vz
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠, we can compute how
</p>
<p>the same vector looks like in the coordinate system of the second
</p>
<p>observer �v =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>vx&prime;
</p>
<p>vy&prime;
</p>
<p>vz&prime;
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ by using the usual trigonometric functions
</p>
<p>sin(φ),cos(φ) and tan(φ) = sin(φ)
cos(φ)
</p>
<p>, as illustrated in Fig. A.1.
</p>
<p>Fig. A.1: Illustration of the components
of a vector in two different coordinate
systems. Details can be found in the
text.
</p>
<p>The relationship between vx and vx&prime; can be computed using
</p>
<p>cos(φ) =
vx&prime;
</p>
<p>vx + a
&rarr; vx&prime; = (vx + a) cos(φ)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>tan(φ) =
a
</p>
<p>vy
&rarr; a = vy tan(φ).
</p>
<p>This yields
</p>
<p>vx&prime; =
(
vx + vy tan(φ)
</p>
<p>)
cos(φ) =
</p>
<p>(
vx + vy
</p>
<p>sin(φ)
</p>
<p>cos(φ)
</p>
<p>)
cos(φ)
</p>
<p>= vx cos(φ) + vy sin(φ).
</p>
<p>Analogously we can use</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>vector calculus 259
</p>
<p>cos(φ) =
vy
</p>
<p>vy&prime; + b
&rarr; vy&prime; = vy
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>cos(φ)
&minus; b
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>tan(φ) =
b
</p>
<p>vx&prime;
&rarr; b = vx&prime; tan(φ),
</p>
<p>which yields using sin2(φ) + cos2(φ) = 1
</p>
<p>vy&prime; = vy
1
</p>
<p>cos(φ)
&minus; vx&prime; tan(φ) = vy
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>cos(φ)

<p>sin(φ)
</p>
<p>cos(φ)
</p>
<p>= vy
sin2(φ) + cos2(φ)
</p>
<p>cos(φ)
&minus; vx sin(φ)&minus; vy
</p>
<p>sin2(φ
</p>
<p>cos(φ)
= vy cos(φ)&minus; vx sin(φ)
</p>
<p>Therefore vy&prime; = &minus;vx sin(φ) + vy cos(φ).
</p>
<p>We can write this using a rotation matrix:
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>vx&prime;
</p>
<p>vy&prime;
</p>
<p>vz&prime;
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ = Rz(φ)�v =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>cos(φ) sin(φ) 0
</p>
<p>&minus; sin(φ) cos(φ) 0
0 0 1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>vx
vy
vz
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠
</p>
<p>=
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>cos(φ)vx + sin(φ)vy
&minus; sin(φ)vx + cos(φ)vy
</p>
<p>vz
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ . (A.9)
</p>
<p>We multiply each row of the matrix with the unrotated vector to
</p>
<p>compute the rotated vector. As already noted above, the component
</p>
<p>along the z-axis v3 is the same for both observers. The matrix Rz(φ)
</p>
<p>describes a rotation by the angle φ about the z-axis.
</p>
<p>A.3 Matrix Multiplication Fig. A.2: Schematic matrix multi-
plication. The important thing to
keep in mind is row times col-
umn. The first index denotes the
row number, the second the col-
umn number. In the example, the
red element of the product matrix is
c1,2 = a1,1b1,2 + a1,2b2,2 and the blue ele-
ment is c3,3 = a3,1b1,3 + a3,2b2,3. In gen-
eral ci,j = ai,kbk,j = ai,1b1,j + ai,2b2,j + . . ..

<p>Computations like this are tremendously simplified through the use
</p>
<p>of matrices. The rule for Matrix multiplication is always row times
</p>
<p>column. We can see the scalar product introduced above as a special
</p>
<p>case of this, if we interpret a vector as a matrix with one column and
</p>
<p>three rows (a 3&times; 1 matrix). The scalar product of two vectors is then

⎟⎠ = vxwx + vywy + vzwz, (A.10)
</p>
<p>where the T denotes transposing, which means that every columns
</p>
<p>becomes a row and every row a column. Therefore, �vT is a matrix</p>

<p>with 1 row and 3 columns. Written in this way the scalar product is
</p>
<p>once more a matrix product with row times columns.
</p>
<p>Analogously, we get the matrix product of two matrices from the
</p>
<p>multiplication of each row of the matrix to the left with a column
</p>
<p>of the matrix to the right. This is explained in Fig. A.2. An explicit
</p>
<p>example for the multiplication of two matrices is

<p>M =
</p>
<p>(
2 3
</p>
<p>1 0
</p>
<p>)
N =

</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>(A.11)
</p>
<p>The rule to keep in mind is row times column. Take note that the
</p>
<p>multiplication of two matrices is not commutative, which means in
</p>
<p>general MN �= NM.
</p>
<p>A.4 Scalars
</p>
<p>An important thing to notice is that the scalar product of two vectors
</p>
<p>has the same value for all observers. This can be seen as the defini-
</p>
<p>tion of a scalar: A scalar is the same for all observers. This does not
</p>
<p>simply mean that every number is a scalar, because each component
</p>
<p>of a vector is a number, but as we have seen above a different number
</p>
<p>for different observers. In contrast the scalar product of two vectors
</p>
<p>must be the same for all observers. This follows from the fact that the
</p>
<p>scalar product of a vector with itself is directly related to the length
</p>
<p>of the vector. Changing the perspective or the location we choose to
</p>
<p>look at our experiment may not change the length of anything. The
</p>
<p>length of a vector is called an invariant for rotations, because it stays
</p>
<p>the same no matter how we rotate our system.
</p>
<p>A.5 Right-handed and Left-handed Coordinate
</p>
<p>Systems
</p>
<p>When we talked above about two observers, we implicitly assumed
</p>
<p>they agree in terms of the definition of their coordinate system. In
</p>
<p>fact, there are two possible choices, which are again related by matrix
</p>
<p>multiplication, but not by rotations. One observer may choose what
</p>
<p>we call a right-handed coordinate system and another observer what
</p>
<p>we call a left-handed coordinate system.Fig. A.3: Right-handed and left-handed

total field energy would be infinity
and such field configurations are non-
physical. B.3 The Taylor Series
</p>
<p>The Taylor series is a formula that enables us to write any infinitely
</p>
<p>differentiable function in terms of a power series
</p>
<p>f (x) = f (a) + (x &minus; a) f &prime;(a) + 1
2
(x &minus; a)2 f &prime;&prime;(a) + . . . (B.4)
</p>
<p>&bull; On the one hand we can use it if we want to know how we can
</p>
<p>write some function in terms of a series. This can be used for
</p>
<p>example to show that eix = cos(x) + i sin(x).
</p>
<p>&bull; On the other hand we can use the Taylor series to get approxi-
</p>
<p>mations for a function about a point. This is useful when we can
</p>
<p>neglect for some reasons higher order terms and don&rsquo;t need to
</p>
<p>consider infinitely many terms. If we want to evaluate a function
</p>
<p>f (x) in some neighbouring point of a point y, say y + ∆y, we can
</p>
<p>write44 Don&rsquo;t let yourself get confused by
the names of our variables here. In the
formula above we want to evaluate the
function at x by doing computations
at a. Here we want to know something
about f at y + ∆y, by using information
at y. To make the connection precise:
x = y + ∆y and a = y.
</p>
<p>f (y + ∆y) = f (y) + (y + ∆y &minus; y) f &prime;(y) + . . . = f (y) + ∆y f &prime;(y) + . . . .
(B.5)
</p>
<p>This means we get an approximation for the function value at
</p>
<p>y + ∆y, by evaluating the function at y. In the extreme case of an
</p>
<p>infinitesimal neighbourhood ∆y &rarr; ǫ, the change of the function
can be written by one (the linear) term of the Taylor series.

<p>calculus 265
</p>
<p>This formula is one of the most useful mathematical tools and
</p>
<p>we can derive it using the fundamental theorem of calculus and
</p>
<p>integration by parts. The fundamental theorem tells us
</p>
<p>&int; x
</p>
<p>a
dt f &prime;(t) = f (x)&minus; f (a) &rarr; f (x) = f (a) +
</p>
<p>&int; x
</p>
<p>a
dt f &prime;(t). (B.7)
</p>
<p>We can rewrite the second term by integrating by parts, because
</p>
<p>we have of course an implicit 1 in front of f &prime;(t) = 1 f &prime;(t), which
we can use as a second function in Eq. B.3: g&prime;(t) = 1. The rule for
integration by parts tells us that we can rewrite an integral
</p>
<p>&int; b
a v
</p>
<p>&prime;u =
vu|ba +
</p>
<p>&int;
vu&prime; by integrating one term and differentiating the other.
</p>
<p>Here we integrate g&prime;(t) = 1 and differentiate f &prime;(t), i.e. in the formula
g&prime; = v&prime; and f &prime; = u. This yields
</p>
<p>f (x) = f (a) +
&int; x
</p>

dt f &prime;(t) = f (a) + g(t) f &prime;(t)

</p>
<p>(B.8)
</p>
<p>Now we need to know what g(t) is. At this point the only infor-
</p>
<p>mation we have is g&prime;(t) = 1, but there are infinitely many functions
with this derivative: For any constant c the function g = t + c satisfies
</p>
<p>g&prime;(t) = 1. Our formula becomes particularly useful5 for g = t &minus; x, i.e. 5 The equation holds for arbitrary c
and of course you&rsquo;re free to choose
something different, but you won&rsquo;t get
our formula. We choose the constant c
such that we get a useful formula for
f (x). Otherwise f (x) would appear on
the left- and right-hand side.
</p>
<p>we use minus the upper integration boundary &minus;x as our constant c.
Then we have for the second term in the equation above
</p>
<p>g(t) f &prime;(t)
∣∣∣

&int; x
</p>
<p>a
dt (x &minus; t) f &prime;&prime;(t). (B.10)
</p>
<p>We can then evaluate the last term once more using integration by

<p>parts, now with6 v&prime; = (x &minus; t) and u = f &prime;&prime;(t): 6 Take note that integrating v&prime; = (x &minus; t)
yields a minus sign: &rarr; v = &minus; 12 (x &minus;

<p>We could go on and integrate the last term by parts, but the pattern

<p>should be visible by now. The Taylor series can be written in a more

the factorial of n, i.e. n! = 1 &middot; 2 &middot; 3 . . . n. For example for n = 5 we have
5! = 5 &middot; 4 &middot; 3 &middot; 2 &middot; 1 = 120, 2! = 2 &middot; 1 = 2 and by definition 0! = 1. Series
are the topic of the next section.
</p>
<p>B.4 Series
</p>
<p>In the last section we stumbled upon a very important formula that
</p>
<p>includes an infinite sum. In this section some basic tricks for sum
</p>
<p>manipulation and some very important series will be introduced.
</p>
<p>B.4.1 Important Series
</p>
<p>In the last section we learned that we can write every infinitely differ-
</p>
<p>entiable function as a series. Let&rsquo;s start with maybe the most impor-
</p>
<p>tant function: The exponential function ex. The Taylor series for the
</p>
<p>exponential function can be written right away
</p>
<p>ex =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>xn
</p>
<p>n!
, (B.13)
</p>
<p>by using the defining feature of the exponential function that the
</p>
<p>derivative is the exponential function itself: (ex)&prime; = ex, evaluating the
Taylor series about a = 0 and using e0 = 1. This yields the Taylor
</p>
<p>series (Eq. B.12) for the exponential function:
</p>
<p>ex =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>e0(x &minus; 0)n
n!
</p>
<p>=
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>xn
</p>
<p>n!
(B.14)
</p>
<p>This series can be seen as a definition of ex.
</p>
<p>Two other important, infinitely differentiable functions are sin(x)
</p>
<p>and cos(x). We can compute the Taylor series for these functions,
</p>
<p>by using (sin(x))&prime; = cos(x), (cos(x))&prime; = &minus; sin(x), cos(0) = 1 and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>calculus 267
</p>
<p>sin(0) = 0.
</p>
<p>sin(x) =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>sin(n)(0)(x &minus; 0)n
n!
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Because of sin(0) = 0 every term with even n vanishes, which we can
</p>
<p>use if we split the sum. Observe that
</p>
<p>&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>n =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>(2n + 1) +
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>(2n)
</p>
<p>1+ 2+ 3+ 4+ 5+ 6 . . . = 1+ 3+ 5+ . . . + 2+ 4+ 6+ . . . (B.15)
</p>
<p>Splitting the sum for sin(x) yields
</p>
<p>sin(x) =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>sin(2n+1)(0)(x &minus; 0)2n+1
(2n + 1)!
</p>
<p>+
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0

<p>sin(2n)(0)(x &minus; 0)2n

</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>sin(2n+1)(0)(x &minus; 0)2n+1
(2n + 1)!
</p>
<p>. (B.16)
</p>
<p>Every even derivative of sin(x), i.e. sin(2n) is again sin(x) (with pos-
</p>
<p>sibly a minus sign in front of it) and therefore the second term van-
</p>
<p>ishes because of sin(0) = 0. Every uneven derivative of sin(x) is
</p>
<p>cos(x), with possibly a minus sign in front of it. We have
</p>
<p>sin(x)(1) = cos(x)
</p>
<p>sin(x)(2) = cos&prime;(x) = &minus; sin(x)
sin(x)(3) = &minus; sin&prime;(x) = &minus; cos(x)
sin(x)(4) = &minus; cos&prime;(x) = sin(x)
sin(x)(5) = sin&prime;(x) = cos(x) . (B.17)
</p>
<p>The pattern is therefore sin(2n+1)(x) = (&minus;1)n cos(x), as you can
check by putting some integer values for n into the formula7. We can 7 sin(1)(x) = sin(2&middot;0+1)(x) =
</p>
<p>(&minus;1)&middot;0 cos(x) = cos(x), sin(3)(x) =
sin(2&middot;1+1)(x) = (&minus;1)1 cos(x) = &minus; cos(x)therefore rewrite Eq. B.16 as
</p>
<p>sin(x) =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>sin(2n+1)(0)(x &minus; 0)2n+1
(2n + 1)!

(2n + 1)!
</p>
<p>. (B.18)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>268 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>This is the Taylor series for sin(x), which again can be seen as a defi-
</p>
<p>nition of sin(x). Analogous we can derive
</p>
<p>cos(x) =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>(&minus;1)n(x)2n
(2n)!
</p>
<p>, (B.19)
</p>
<p>because this time uneven derivatives are proportional to sin(0) = 0.
</p>
<p>B.4.2 Splitting Sums
</p>
<p>In the last section we used a trick that is quite useful in many compu-
</p>
<p>tations. There we used the example
</p>
<p>&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>n =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>(2n + 1) +
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>(2n)
</p>
<p>1+ 2+ 3+ 4+ 5+ 6 . . . = 1+ 3+ 5+ . . . + 2+ 4+ 6+ . . . , (B.20)
</p>
<p>to motivate how we can split any sum in terms of even and uneven
</p>
<p>integers. 2n is always an even integer, whereas 2n + 1 is always an
</p>
<p>uneven integer. We already saw in the last section that this can be
</p>
<p>useful, but let&rsquo;s look at another example. What happens if we split
</p>
<p>the exponential series with complex argument ix?
</p>
<p>eix =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>(ix)n
</p>
<p>n!
</p>
<p>=
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>(ix)2n

</p>
<p>&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>(ix)2n+1
</p>
<p>(2n + 1)!
. (B.21)
</p>
<p>This can be rewritten using that (ix)2n = i2nx2n and i2n = (i2)n =
</p>
<p>(&minus;1)n. In addition we have of course i2n+1 = i &middot; i2n = i(&minus;1)n. Then
we have
</p>
<p>eix =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0

</p>
<p>B.4.3 Einstein&rsquo;s Sum Convention
</p>
<p>Sums are very common in physics and writing the big sum sign &sum;
</p>
<p>all the time can be quite cumbersome. For this reason a clever man
</p>
<p>introduced a convention, called Einstein sum convention. According
</p>
<p>to this convention every time an index appears twice in some term,
</p>
<p>like n in the sums above, an implicit sum is understood. This means
</p>
<p>anbn &equiv; &sum;
n
</p>
<p>anbn. (B.23)
</p>
<p>Other examples are
</p>
<p>anbncm &equiv; &sum;
n
</p>
<p>anbncm. (B.24)
</p>
<p>ambncm &equiv; &sum;
m
</p>
<p>ambncm. (B.25)
</p>
<p>but
</p>
<p>anbm �= &sum;
n
</p>
<p>anbm, (B.26)
</p>
<p>because in general m �= n. An index without a partner is called a free
index, an index with a partner a dummy index, for reasons that will
</p>
<p>be explained in the next section.
</p>
<p>For example in the sum anbncm &equiv; &sum;n anbncm, the index n is a
dummy index, but m is a free index. Equivalently, in ambncm &equiv; &sum;m ambncm,
the index m is a dummy index and n is free.
</p>
<p>B.5 Index Notation
</p>
<p>B.5.1 Dummy Indices
</p>
<p>It is important to take note that the name of indices with a partner
</p>
<p>plays absolutely no role. Renaming n &rarr; k, changes absolutely noth-
ing8, as long as n is contracted 8 Of course we can&rsquo;t change an index
</p>
<p>into another type of index. For ex-
ample, we can change i &rarr; j but not
i &rarr; μ, because Greek indices like μ are
always summed from 0 to 3 and Roman
indices, like i from 1 to 3.
</p>
<p>anbncm = akbkcm &equiv; &sum;
n
</p>
<p>anbncm &equiv; &sum;
k
</p>
<p>akbkcm. (B.27)
</p>
<p>On the other hand free indices can not be renamed freely. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, m &rarr; q can make quite a difference because there must be some
term on the other side of the equation with the same free index. This
</p>
<p>means when we look at a term like anbncm isolated, we must always
</p>
<p>take into account that there might be other terms with the same free
</p>
<p>index m that must be renamed, too. Let&rsquo;s look at an example
</p>
<p>Fi = ǫijkajbk. (B.28)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>270 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>A new thing that appears here is that some object, here ǫijk, is al-
</p>
<p>lowed to carry more than one index, but don&rsquo;t let that bother you,
</p>
<p>because we will come back to this in a moment. Therefore, if we look
</p>
<p>at ǫijkajbk we can change the names of j and k as we like, because
</p>
<p>these indices are contracted. For example j &rarr; u, k &rarr; z, which yields
ǫiuzaubz is really the same. On the other hand i is not a dummy index
</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t rename it i &rarr; m: ǫmuzaubz , because then our equation
would read
</p>
<p>Fi = ǫmuzaubz. (B.29)
</p>
<p>This may seem pedantic at this point, because it is clear that we need
</p>
<p>to rename i at Fi, too in order to get something sensible, but more
</p>
<p>often than not will we look at isolated terms and it is important to
</p>
<p>know what we are allowed to do without changing anything.
</p>
<p>B.5.2 Objects with more than One Index
</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about objects with more than one index. Objects with
</p>
<p>two indices are simply matrices. The first index tells us which row
</p>
<p>and the second index which column we should pick our value from.
</p>
<p>For example
</p>
<p>Mij &equiv;
(
</p>
<p>M11 M12
M21 M22
</p>
<p>)
. (B.30)
</p>
<p>This means for example that M12 is the object in the first row in the
</p>
<p>second column.
</p>
<p>We can use this to write matrix multiplication using indices. The
</p>
<p>product of two matrices is
</p>
<p>MN &equiv; (MN)ij = Mik Nkj. (B.31)
</p>
<p>On the left hand side we have the element in row i in column j of
</p>
<p>the product matrix (MN), which we get from multiplying the i-th
</p>
<p>row of M with the j-th column of N. The index k appears twice and
</p>
<p>therefore an implicit sum is assumed. One can give names to objects
</p>
<p>with three or more indices (tensors). For the purpose of this book
</p>
<p>two are enough and we will discuss only one exception, which is the
</p>
<p>topic of one of the next sections.
</p>
<p>B.5.3 Symmetric and Antisymmetric Indices
</p>
<p>A matrix is said to be symmetric if Mij = Mji. This means in our two
</p>
<p>dimensional example M12 = M21 and an example for a symmetric</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>calculus 271
</p>
<p>matrix is
</p>
<p>(
9 3
</p>
<p>3 17
</p>
<p>)
. (B.32)
</p>
<p>A matrix is called totally antisymmetric if Mij = &minus;Mji for all i, j
holds. An example would be.
</p>
<p>(
0 3
</p>
<p>&minus;3 0
</p>
<p>)
. (B.33)
</p>
<p>Take note that the diagonal elements must vanish here, because
</p>
<p>M11 = &minus;M11, which is only satisfied for M11 = 0 and analogously for
M22.
</p>
<p>B.5.4 Antisymmetric &times; Symmetric Sums
An important observation is that every time we have a sum over
</p>
<p>something symmetric in its indices multiplied with something anti-
</p>
<p>symmetric in the same indices, the result is zero:
</p>
<p>&sum;
ij
</p>
<p>aijbij = 0 (B.34)
</p>
<p>if aij = &minus;aji and bij = bji holds for all i, j. We can see this by writing
</p>
<p>&sum;
ij
</p>
<p>aijbij =
1
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>(
&sum;
ij
</p>
<p>aijbij + &sum;
ij
</p>
<p>aijbij
</p>
<p>)
(B.35)
</p>
<p>As explained earlier we are free to rename our dummy indices i &rarr; j
and j &rarr; i, which we use in the second term
</p>
<p>&rarr; &sum;
ij
</p>
<p>aijbij =
1
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>(
&sum;
ij
</p>
<p>aijbij + &sum;
ij
</p>
<p>ajibji
</p>
<p>)
(B.36)
</p>
<p>Then we use the symmetry of bij and antisymmetry of aij, to switch
</p>
<p>the indices in the second term, which yields9 9 If this looks like a cheap trick to you,
you should compute some explicit
examples to see that this is really true.

<p>B.5.5 Two Important Symbols
</p>
<p>One of the most important matrices is of course the unit matrix. In
</p>
<p>two dimensions we have
</p>
<p>1 =
</p>
<p>(
1 0
</p>
<p>0 1
</p>
<p>)
. (B.38)
</p>
<p>In index notation the unit matrix is called the Kronecker symbol,
</p>
<p>denoted δij, which is then defined for arbitrary dimensions by
</p>
<p>δij =
</p>
<p>⎧
⎨
⎩
1 if i = j,
</p>
<p>0 if i �= j .
(B.39)
</p>
<p>The Kronecker symbol is symmetric because δij = δji.
</p>
<p>Equally important is the Levi-Civita symbol ǫijk, which is defined
</p>
<p>in two dimensions as follows:
</p>
<p>ǫij =
</p>
<p>⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
</p>
<p>1 if (i, j) = {(1, 2)},
0 if i = j ,
</p>
<p>&minus;1 if (i, j) = {(2, 1)}.
(B.40)
</p>
<p>In matrix form, we can write it as
</p>
<p>ǫij =
</p>
<p>(
0 1
</p>
<p>&minus;1 0
</p>
<p>)
(B.41)
</p>
<p>In three dimensions the Levi-Civita symbol is
</p>
<p>ǫijk =
</p>
<p>⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
</p>
<p>1 if (i, j, k) = {(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2)},
0 if i = j or j = k or k = i,
</p>
<p>&minus;1 if (i, j, k) = {(1, 3, 2), (3, 2, 1), (2, 1, 3)}.
(B.42)
</p>
<p>and in four dimensions
</p>
<p>ǫijkl =
</p>
<p>⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
</p>
<p>1 if (i, j, k, l) is an even permutation of{(1, 2, 3, 4)},
&minus;1 if (i, j, k, l) is an uneven permutation of{(1, 2, 3, 4)},
0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>(B.43)
</p>
<p>For example (1, 2, 4, 3) is an uneven (because we make one change)
</p>
<p>and (2, 1, 4, 3) is an even permutation (because we make two changes)
</p>
<p>of (1, 2, 3, 4).
</p>
<p>The Levi-Civita symbol is totally anti-symmetric because if we
</p>
<p>change two indices, we always get, by definition, a minus sign:
</p>
<p>ǫijk = &minus;ǫjik, ǫijk = &minus;ǫikj etc. or in two dimensions ǫij = &minus;ǫji.</p>

<p>C
</p>
<p>Linear Algebra
</p>
<p>Many computations can be simplified by using matrices and tricks
</p>
<p>from the linear algebra toolbox. Therefore, let&rsquo;s look at some basic
</p>
<p>transformations.
</p>
<p>C.1 Basic Transformations
</p>
<p>The complex conjugate of a matrix is defined as
</p>
<p>M⋆ij =
</p>
<p>(
M⋆11 M
</p>
<p>⋆
12
</p>
<p>M⋆21 M
⋆
22
</p>
<p>)
, (C.1)
</p>
<p>which means we simply take the complex conjugate of each ele-
</p>
<p>ment1. 1 Recall that the complex conjugate of a
complex number z = a + ib, where a is
the real part and b the imaginary part,
is simply z⋆ = a &minus; ib.
</p>

<p>which means we swap columns and rows of the matrix. An impor-
</p>
<p>tant consequence of this definition and the definition of the prod-
</p>
<p>uct of two matrices is that we have (MN)T �= MT NT . Instead
(MN)T = NT MT , which means by transposing we switch the po-
</p>
<p>sition of two matrices in a product. We can see this directly in index
</p>
<p>notation
</p>
<p>MN &equiv; (MN)ij = Mik Nkj

<p>274 physics from symmetry
</p>
<p>where in the last step we use the general rule that in matrix notation
</p>
<p>we always multiply rows of the left matrix with columns of the right
</p>
<p>matrix. To write this in matrix notation, we change the position of the
</p>
<p>two terms to Njk Mki, which is rows of the left matrix times columns
</p>
<p>of the right matrix, as it should be and we can write in matrix nota-
</p>
<p>tion NT MT .
</p>
<p>Take note that in index notation we can always change the position
</p>
<p>of the objects in question freely, because for example Mki and Njk are
</p>
<p>just individual elements of the matrices, i.e. ordinary numbers.
</p>
<p>C.2 Matrix Exponential Function
</p>
<p>We already derived how the exponential function looks as a series,
</p>
<p>and therefore we can define what we mean when we put a matrix
</p>
<p>into the exponential function:
</p>
<p>eM, with an arbitrary matrix M, is defined by the series
</p>
<p>eM =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
n=0
</p>
<p>Mn
</p>
<p>n!
. (C.4)
</p>
<p>It is important to take note that in general eMeN �= eM+N . The iden-
tity eMeN = eM+N is only correct if MN = NM.
</p>
<p>C.3 Determinants
</p>
<p>The determinant of a matrix is a rather unintuitive, but immensely
</p>
<p>useful notion. For example, if the determinant of some matrix is
</p>
<p>non-zero, we automatically know that the matrix is invertible2. Un-2 A matrix M is invertible, if we can find
an inverse matrix, denoted by M&minus;1,
with M&minus;1M = 1.
</p>
<p>fortunately proving this lies beyond the scope of this text and the
</p>
<p>interested reader is referred to the standard texts about linear alge-
</p>
<p>bra.
</p>
<p>The determinant of a 3 &times; 3 matrix can be defined using the Levi-
Civita symbol
</p>
<p>det(A) =
3
</p>
<p>&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>&sum;
j=1
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>&sum;
k=1
</p>
<p>ǫijk A1i A2j A3k (C.5)
</p>
<p>and analogously for n-dimensions
</p>
<p>det(A) =
n
</p>
<p>&sum;
i1=1
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>&sum;
i2=1
</p>
<p>. . .
n
</p>
<p>&sum;
in=1
</p>
<p>ǫi1i2 ...in A1i1 A2i2 . . . Anin . (C.6)
</p>
<p>It is instructive to look at an explicit example in two dimensions:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>det(A) = det
</p>
<p>(
3 1
</p>
<p>5 2
</p>
<p>)
= (3 &middot; 2)&minus; (5 &middot; 1) = 1 .
</p>
<p>For a general three dimensional matrix, we have
</p>
<p>det
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>a1 a2 a3
b1 b2 b3
c1 c2 c3
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ = a1(b2c3&minus; b3c2)&minus; a2(b1c3&minus; b3c1)+ a3(b1c2&minus; b2c1) .
</p>
<p>(C.7)
</p>
<p>C.4 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
</p>
<p>Two very important notions from linear algebra that are used all over
</p>
<p>physics are eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors �v and
</p>
<p>eigenvalues λ are defined for each matrix M by the equation
</p>
<p>M�v = λ�v. (C.8)
</p>
<p>The important thing is that we have on both sides of the equation
</p>
<p>the same vector �v. In words this equation means that the vector �v
</p>
<p>remains, up to a constant λ, unchanged if multiplied with the matrix
</p>
<p>M. To each eigenvector we have a corresponding eigenvalue. There
</p>
<p>are quite sophisticated computational schemes for finding the eigen-
</p>
<p>vectors and eigenvalues of a matrix and the details can be found in
</p>
<p>any book about linear algebra.
</p>
<p>To get a feeling for the importance of these notions think about
</p>
<p>rotations. We can describe rotations by matrices and the eigenvector
</p>
<p>of a rotation matrix defines the rotational axis.
</p>
<p>C.5 Diagonalization
</p>
<p>Eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be used to bring matrices into diag-
</p>
<p>onal form, which can be quite useful for computations and physical
</p>
<p>interpretations. It can be shown that any diagonalizable matrix M
</p>
<p>can be rewritten in the form3 3 In general, a transformation of the
form M&prime; = N&minus;1MN refers to a basis
change. M&prime; is the matrix M in another
coordinate system. Therefore, the result
of this section is that we can find a basis
where M is particularly simple, i.e.
diagonal.
</p>
<p>M = N&minus;1DN, (C.9)
</p>
<p>where the matrix N consists of the eigenvectors as its column and D
</p>
<p>is diagonal with the eigenvalues of M on its diagonal:
</p>
<p>(
M11 M12
M21 M22

<p>Additional Mathematical
</p>
<p>Notions
</p>
<p>D.1 Fourier Transform
</p>
<p>The idea of the Fourier transform is similar to the idea that we can
</p>
<p>express any vector �v in terms of basis vectors1 ( �e1, �e2, �e3). In ordinary 1 This is explained in more detail in
Appendix A.1.Euclidean space the most common choice is
</p>
<p>�e1 =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ , �e2 =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
0
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ , �e3 =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
0
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ (D.1)
</p>
<p>and an arbitrary three-dimensional vector �v can be expressed in
</p>
<p>terms of these basis vectors
</p>
<p>�v =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
</p>
<p>v1
v2
v3
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ = v1�e1 + v2�e2 + v3�e3 = v1
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠+ v2
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
0
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠+ v3
</p>
<p>⎛
⎜⎝
0
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>⎞
⎟⎠ (D.2)
</p>
<p>The idea of the Fourier transform is that we can do the same
</p>
<p>thing with functions2. For periodic functions such a basis is given
</p>
<p>2 In a more abstract sense, functions
are abstract vectors. This is meant in
the sense that functions are elements of
some vector space. For different kinds
of functions a different vector space.
Such abstract vector spaces are defined
similar to the usual Euclidean vector
space, where our ordinary position
vectors live (those with the little arrow
� ). For example, take note that we can
add two functions, just as we can add
two vectors, and get another function.
In addition, it&rsquo;s possible to define a
scalar product.
</p>
<p>by sin(kx) and cos(kx). This means we can write every periodic func-
</p>
<p>tion f (x) as
</p>
<p>f (x) =
&infin;
</p>
<p>&sum;
k=0
</p>
<p>(ak cos(kx) + bk sin(kx)) (D.3)
</p>
<p>with constant coefficients ak and bk.
</p>
<p>An arbitrary (not necessarily periodic) function can be written
</p>
<p>in terms of the basis eikx and e&minus;ikx, but this time with an integral
instead of a sum3 3 Recall that an integral is just the limit
</p>
<p>of a sum, where the discrete k in &sum;k
becomes a continuous variable in
</p>
<p>&int;
dk.

</p>
<p>&minus;ikx. (D.5)
</p>
<p>The expansion coefficients fk are often denoted f̃ (k), which is then
</p>
<p>called the Fourier transform of f (x).
</p>
<p>D.2 Delta Distribution
</p>
<p>In some sense, the delta distribution is to integrals what the Kro-
</p>
<p>necker delta4 is to sums. We can use the Kronecker delta δij to pick4 The Kronecker delta is defined in
Appendix B.5.5. one specific term of any sum. For example, consider
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>aibj = a1bj + a2bj + a3bj (D.6)
</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say we want to pick the second term of the sum. We can do
</p>
<p>this using the Kronecker delta δ2i, because then
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>δ2iaibj = δ21︸︷︷︸
=0
</p>
<p>a1bj + δ22︸︷︷︸
=1
</p>
<p>a2bj + δ23︸︷︷︸
=0
</p>
<p>a3bj = a2bj. (D.7)
</p>
<p>Or more general
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>δikaibj = akbj. (D.8)
</p>
<p>The delta distribution δ(x &minus; y) is defined as an object that has exactly
this property:
</p>
<p>&int;
dx f (x)δ(x &minus; y) = f (y). (D.9)
</p>
<p>Completely analogous to the Kronecker delta, the delta distribution
</p>
<p>picks one term from the integral5. In addition, we can use this anal-5 The term where x = y. For example,&int;
dx f (x)δ(x &minus; 2) = f (2). ogy to motivate from the equality
</p>
<p>&part;xi
&part;xj
</p>
<p>= δij (D.10)
</p>
<p>the equality
&part; f (xi)
</p>
<p>&part; f (xj)
= δ(xi &minus; xj). (D.11)
</p>
<p>This is of course by no means a proof, but this equality can be shown
</p>
<p>in a rigorous way, too. There is a lot more one can say about this ob-
</p>
<p>ject, but for the purpose of this book it is enough to understand what</p>
