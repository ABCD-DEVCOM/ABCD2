<p><font size="2">This option enables you top define database variables which you can use for the extraction of statistics.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">It requires three columns of data:</font></p>
<p>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" width="95%" summary="" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><font size="2">Field</font></td>
            <td><font size="2">Define the title of the field as you want it to display in the rows and columns of the table of frequency or occurrence</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font size="2"> <br />
            Extraction Format</font></td>
            <td><font size="2">The pft is going to be used to extract the contents of the field in the database in order to mirror it in the table of frequency or occurrence. The value produced by the PFT will be used as the heading of the corresponding row or column which will be added to by the action of totalling</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font size="2">&nbsp;Prefijo</font></td>
            <td><font size="2">&nbsp;(Yet to be implemented) To allow the extraction of variables directly from the inverted file, reducing thereby the time taken to read the data</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></td>
            <td><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font size="2">This file is named <strong>stats.cfg</strong> and is poplaced in the folder <strong>def </strong>of the corresponding database.</font></p>
<p>LThe variables defined here can be used in two types of process:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For output of tables of occurence or tables of frequency, selecting the variables are going to rows and the variables that are going to columns</li>
    <li>For preparing pre-defined tables from which the results will be extracted by selecting the name from the correpsonding box</li>
</ul>
