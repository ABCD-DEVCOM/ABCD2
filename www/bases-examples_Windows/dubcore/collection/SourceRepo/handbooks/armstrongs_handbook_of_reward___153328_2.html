<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 239
<p>the jobs to be evaluated, but to different degrees. The 2007 e-reward job evaluation survey
established that the respondents&rsquo; schemes had between 3 and 14 factors, the average number
being five.
<p>Each factor is divided into a hierarchy of levels, typically five or six. Definitions of these levels
are produced to provide guidance on deciding the degree to which the factor applies in the job
to be evaluated. A maximum points score is allocated to each factor. The scores available may
vary between different factors in accordance with beliefs about their relative significance. This
is termed explicit weighting. If the number of levels varies between factors this means that they
are implicitly weighted, because the range of scores available will be greater in the factors with
more levels.
<p>The total score for a factor is divided between the levels to produce the numerical factor scale.
Progression may be arithmetic, eg 50, 100, 150, 200, or geometric, eg 40, 90, 150, 220. In the
latter case, more scope is given to recognize senior jobs with higher scores.
<p>The complete scheme consists of the factor and level definitions and the scoring system (the
total score available for each factor and distributed to the factor levels). This comprises the
&lsquo;factor plan&rsquo;.
<p>Jobs are &lsquo;scored&rsquo; (ie allocated points) under each factor heading on the basis of the level of the
factor in the job. This is done by comparing the features of the job with regard to that factor
with the factor level definitions to find out which definition provides the best fit. The separate
factor scores are then added together to give a total score that indicates the relative value for
each job and can be used to place the jobs in rank order.
<p>Evaluators, often formed into a panel consisting of management and staff representatives,
have to interpret the definitions when comparing them with the job. But there are limits to the
precision with which levels can be defined and the extent to which information about the job
indicates which level is appropriate. Judgement is therefore required in making a &lsquo;best fit&rsquo;
decision and this is why point-factor evaluation, like any other form of valuing jobs, can never
be wholly objective.
<p>The members of a job evaluation panel often disagree initially about an evaluation and con-
sensus may only be obtained after a prolonged discussion. The role of the panel facilitator is
crucial in obtaining agreement without too many compromises. However, as evaluators
become more experienced, possibly during the development and testing phases of a scheme,
they become more skilled at interpreting the factor plan and the job information. They estab-
lish &lsquo;conventions&rsquo; that, on the basis of past decisions and precedents, expand and clarify the
meaning of level definitions and indicate how the information about a job can be interpreted
in order to make a judgement.
<p>A weighted factor plan is illustrated in Figure 16.1. In this example, the evaluations are aster-
isked and the total score would be 450 points. Examples of factor level definitions are given in
Figure 16.2.</p>

<p>Judgement and decision making: The requirement to exercise judgement
in making decisions and solving problems, including the degree to which the
work involves choice of action or creativity.
<p>The work is well de�ned and relatively few new situations are
encountered. The causes of problems are readily identi�able and
can be dealt with easily.
<p>Evaluation of information is required to deal with occasional new
problems and situations and to decide on a course of action from
known alternatives. Occasionally required to participate in the
modi�cation of existing procedures and practices.

considered and the courses of action are not obvious. May fairly

unusual problems and situations where no policy guidelines or
precedents are available. May also frequently be responsible for
devising new strategies and approaches that require the use of
imagination and ingenuity.

of thought in assessing con�icting information and balancing the
risks associated with possible solutions. Additionally, one of the
main requirements of the role may be to develop fundamentally
new strategies and approaches.

<p>Figure 16.2 Example of factor level definitions
<p>A point-factor scheme can be operated manually &ndash; a &lsquo;paper&rsquo; scheme &ndash; or computers can be used to
aid the evaluation process. Methods of designing a scheme are described at the end of the chapter.
<p>Analytical job matching
<p>Like point-factor job evaluation, analytical job matching is based on the analysis of a number
of defined factors. There are two forms of analytical matching. One matches role profile to
grade/level profile; the other matches role profile to benchmark role profile.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 241
<p>Role-to-grade analytical matching
<p>Profiles of roles to be evaluated that have been analysed and described in terms of a number of
job evaluation factors are compared with grade, band or level profiles that have been analysed
and described in terms of the same job evaluation factors. The role profiles are then &lsquo;matched&rsquo;
with the range of grade or level profiles to establish the best fit and thus grade the job.
<p>Role-to-role analytical matching
<p>Role profiles for jobs to be evaluated, analysed and described in terms of a number of job eval-
uation factors are matched analytically with benchmark role profiles that have been defined
under the same factor headings. A benchmark job is one that has already been graded as a
result of an initial job evaluation exercise. It is a typical job that represents the different occu-
pations and levels of work in an organization and is used as a point of reference with which
other jobs can be compared and evaluated. If there is a good fit between a role to be evaluated
and a benchmark role that has already been graded, then the role being evaluated will be
placed in that grade. Generic role profiles, that is those covering a number of like roles, will be
used for any class or cluster of roles with essentially the same range of responsibilities, such as
team leaders or personal assistants. Role-to-role matching may be combined with role-to-
grade matching.
<p>Use of analytical matching
<p>Analytical matching can be used to grade jobs or place them in levels following the initial eval-
uation of a sufficiently large sample of benchmark jobs: representative jobs that can provide a
valid basis for comparisons. This can happen in big organizations when it is believed that it is
not necessary to go through the whole process of point-factor evaluation for every job, espe-
cially where &lsquo;generic&rsquo; roles are concerned. When this follows a large job evaluation exercise
such as in the NHS, the factors used in analytical matching may be the same as those in the
point-factor job evaluation scheme that underpins the analytical matching process and can be
invoked to deal with difficult cases or appeals. In some matching schemes the number of
factors may be simplified; for example, the HERA scheme for higher education institutions
clusters related factors together, reducing the number of factors from seven to four.
<p>However, analytical matching may not necessarily be underpinned by a point-factor evalua-
tion scheme, and this can save a lot of time in the design stage as well as when rolling out the
scheme.</p>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>242 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Factor comparison
<p>The original factor comparison method compared jobs factor by factor, using a scale of money
values to provide a direct indication of the rate for the job. It was developed in the United
States but is not used in the UK. The Hay Guide Chart Profile method (a &lsquo;proprietary brand&rsquo;
of job evaluation) is described by the Hay Group as a factor comparison scheme but, apart
from this, the only form of factor comparison now in use is graduated factor comparison,
which compares jobs factor by factor with a graduated scale. The scale may have only three
value levels &ndash; for example lower, equal, higher &ndash; and no factor scores are used. This is a method
often used by the independent experts engaged by employment tribunals to advise on an equal
pay claim. Their job is simply to compare one job with one or two others, not to review inter-
nal relativities over the whole spectrum of jobs in order to produce a rank order.
<p>Tailor-made, ready-made and hybrid schemes
<p>Any of the schemes referred to above can be &lsquo;tailor-made&rsquo; or &lsquo;home-grown&rsquo; in the sense that
they are developed specifically by or for an organization, a group of organizations or a sector,
such as further education establishments. The 2007 e-reward survey showed that only 20 per
cent of the schemes were tailor-made. A number of management consultants offer their own
&lsquo;ready-made&rsquo; schemes or &lsquo;proprietary brands&rsquo;. Consultants&rsquo; schemes tend to be analytical
(point-factor, factor comparison or matching) and may be linked to a market rate database.
They often provide for computer aid. As many as 60 per cent of the respondents to the e-reward
survey used these schemes.
<p>Hybrid schemes are consultants&rsquo; schemes that have been modified to fit the particular needs
of an organization; 20 per cent of the e-reward respondents had such schemes. Typically, the
modification consists of amendments to the factor plan or, in the case of Hay, to the Hay
Guide Chart.
<p>Non-analytical schemes
<p>Non-analytical job evaluation schemes enable whole jobs to be compared in order to place
them in a grade or a rank order &ndash; they are not analysed by reference to their elements or
factors. They can stand alone or be used to help in the development of an analytical scheme.
For example, the paired comparison technique described later can produce a rank order of
jobs that can be used to test the outcomes of an evaluation using an analytical scheme. It is
therefore helpful to know how non-analytical schemes function even if they are not used as the
main scheme.
<p>Non-analytical schemes can operate on a job-to-job basis in which one job is compared with
another to decide whether it should be valued more, or less, or the same (ranking and &lsquo;internal </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 243
<p>benchmarking&rsquo; processes). Alternatively, they may function on a job-to-grade basis in which
judgements are made by comparing a whole job with a defined hierarchy of job grades (job
classification) &ndash; this involves matching a job description to a grade description. They are dis-
tinguished from analytical matching schemes, which are based on the analysis and compari-
son of jobs on a factor-by-factor basis rather than the &lsquo;whole-job&rsquo; comparisons used in
non-analytical schemes. The e-reward 2007 survey showed that only 14 per cent of respond-
ents&rsquo; schemes were non-analytical.
<p>Non-analytical schemes are relatively simple but rely on more subjective judgements than
analytical schemes. Such judgements will not be guided by a factor plan and do not take
account of the complexity of jobs. There is a danger therefore of leaping to conclusions
about job values based on a priori assumptions that could be prejudiced. For this reason,
non-analytical schemes do not provide a defence in a UK equal pay case.
<p>There are four main types of non-analytical schemes: job classification, job ranking, paired
comparison (a statistical version of ranking) and internal benchmarking.
<p>Job classification
<p>This approach is based on a definition of the number and characteristics of the levels or
grades in a grade and pay structure into which jobs will be placed. The grade definitions may
refer to such job characteristics as skill, decision making and responsibility but these are not
analysed separately. Evaluation takes place by a process of non-analytical matching or &lsquo;job
slotting&rsquo;. This involves comparing a &lsquo;whole&rsquo; job description (ie one not analysed into
factors), with the grade definitions to establish the grade with which the job most closely
corresponds. The difference between job classification and role-to-grade analytical match-
ing as described above is that in the latter case the grade profiles are defined analytically, that
is in terms of job evaluation factors, and analytically defined role profiles are matched with
them factor by factor. However, the distinction between analytical and non-analytical
matching can be blurred when the comparison is made between formal job descriptions or
role profiles that have been prepared in a standard format that includes common headings
for such aspects of jobs as levels of responsibility or knowledge and skill requirements. These
&lsquo;factors&rsquo; may not be compared specifically but will be taken into account when forming a
judgement. But this may not satisfy the UK legal requirement that a scheme must be ana-
lytical to provide a defence in an equal pay claim.
<p>Job ranking
<p>Whole-job ranking is the most primitive form of job evaluation. The process involves com-
paring whole jobs with one another and arranging them in order of their perceived value to
the organization. In a sense, all evaluation schemes are ranking exercises because they place
jobs in a hierarchy. The difference between simple ranking and analytical methods such as </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>244 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>point-factor rating is that job ranking does not attempt to quantify judgements. Instead, whole
jobs are compared &ndash; they are not broken down into factors or elements although, explicitly or
implicitly, the comparison may be based on some generalized concept such as the level of
responsibility. Job ranking or paired comparison ranking as described below is sometimes
used as a check on the rank order obtained by point-factor rating.
<p>Paired comparison ranking
<p>Paired comparison ranking is a statistical technique that is used to provide a more sophisti-
cated method of whole-job ranking. It is based on the assumption that it is always easier to
compare one job with another than to consider a number of jobs and attempt to build up a
rank order by multiple comparisons.
<p>The technique requires the comparison of each job as a whole separately with every other job.
If a job is considered to be of a higher value than the one with which it is being compared, it
receives two points; if it is thought to be equally important, it receives one point; if it is regarded
as less important, no points are awarded. The scores are added for each job and a rank order
is obtained.
<p>Paired comparisons can be done factor by factor and in this case can be classified as analytical.
A simplified example of a paired comparison ranking is shown in Figure 16.3.
<p>The advantage of paired comparison ranking over normal ranking is that it is easier to compare
one job with another rather than having to make multi-comparisons. But it cannot overcome
the fundamental objections to any form of whole-job ranking &ndash; that no defined standards for
judging relative worth are provided and it is not an acceptable method of assessing equal value
or comparable worth. There is also a limit to the number of jobs that can be compared using
this method &ndash; to evaluate 50 jobs requires 1,225 comparisons. Paired comparisons are occa-
sionally used analytically to compare jobs on a factor-by-factor basis.

<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 245
<p>Internal benchmarking
<p>Internal benchmarking means comparing the job under review with any internal job that is
believed to be properly graded and paid (a benchmark job) and placing the job under consid-
eration into the same grade as that job. It is what people often do intuitively when they are
deciding on the value of jobs, although it is not usually dignified in job evaluation circles as a
formal method of job evaluation. The comparison is made on a whole-job basis without ana-
lysing the jobs factor by factor. It can be classified as a formal method if there are specific pro-
cedures for preparing and setting out role profiles and for comparing profiles for the role to be
evaluated with standard benchmark role profiles.
<p>Market pricing
<p>Market pricing is the process of obtaining information on market rates (market rate analysis)
to inform decisions on pay structures and individual rates of pay. It is called &lsquo;extreme market
pricing&rsquo; when market rates are the sole means of deciding on internal rates of pay and rela-
tivities, and conventional job evaluation is not used. An organization that adopts this method
is said to be &lsquo;market driven&rsquo;. Techniques of collecting and analysing market rate data are
described in Chapter 18. This approach has been widely adopted in the United States. It is
associated with a belief that &lsquo;the market rules, OK&rsquo;, disillusionment with what was regarded as
bureaucratic job evaluation, and the enthusiasm for broad-banded pay structures (structures
with a limited number of grades or bands, as described in Chapter 19). It is a method that
often has appeal at board level because of the focus on the need to compete in the market place
for talent.
<p>Market rate analysis, as distinct from extreme market pricing, may be associated with formal
job evaluation. The latter establishes internal relativities and the grade structure, and market
pricing is used to develop the pay structure &ndash; the pay ranges attached to grades. Information
on market rates may lead to the introduction of market supplements for individual jobs or
the creation of separate pay structures (market groups) to cater for particular market rate
pressures.
<p>The acceptability of either form of market pricing is dependent on the availability of robust
market data (not always easy) and, when looking at external rates, the quality of the job-to-
job matching process (ie comparing like with like). It can therefore vary from analysis of
data by job titles to detailed matched analysis collected through bespoke surveys focused on
real market equivalence. Extreme market pricing can provide guidance on internal relativi-
ties even if these are market driven. But it can lead to pay discrimination against women
where the market has traditionally been discriminatory and it does not satisfy UK equal pay
legislation. To avoid a successful equal pay claim in the UK, any difference in pay between
men and women carrying out work of equal value based on market rate considerations has </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>246 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>to be &lsquo;objectively justified&rsquo;; in other words, the employment tribunal will need to be con-
vinced that this was not simply a matter of opinion and that adequate evidence from a
number of sources was available. In such cases, the tribunal will also require proof that there
is a business case for the market premium to the effect that the recruitment and retention of
essential people for the organization was difficult because pay levels were uncompetitive.
<p>Levelling
<p>Levelling is an approach to job evaluation that focuses on defining the levels of work in an
organization and fitting jobs into those levels. The levels may be defined in terms of one factor
such as decision making. It may serve as the basis for a pay structure but, increasingly, levelling
contributes to organizational analysis, provides guidance on career mapping and the develop-
ment and description of international organization structures, and acts as a link to an infor-
mation technology system such as PeopleSoft or SAP.
<p>The levelling concept
<p>The concept of defining levels of work was a feature of the work of Elliott Jaques (1956) on the
measurement of responsibility. His research at Glacier Metal led to the conclusion that: &lsquo;It
appeared as though there existed in people&rsquo;s minds a pattern of rates expected for levels of
work done, and that this pattern was made manifest by stating level of work in maximum
time-span terms.&rsquo; This was his concept of the time span of discretion, which he defined as &lsquo;The
maximum period of time that would elapse under the particular conditions of review, during
which the member was authorized and expected to exercise discretion on his own account to
discharge the responsibilities allocated to him&rsquo;. He proposed that levels of work should be
defined in terms of time span. This had some appeal as seemingly providing a single significant
criterion for measuring responsibility, but it has not been widely adopted because of measure-
ment difficulties, especially at higher levels. One example of a firm using time span as the main
criterion is Nationwide, as illustrated in Figure 16.4.
<p>An alternative criterion for defining levels of work, called the decision band method (DBM),
was evolved by Paterson (1974). He observed that there are six levels or bands of decision
making in organizations. They range from simple defined decisions &lsquo;made within the limits
of a prescribed operation&rsquo;, to corporate policy-making decisions that &lsquo;determine the scope,
direction and goal of the whole enterprise&rsquo;. These definitions are used as the basis for assign-
ing jobs to levels. The DBM method was adopted extensively in Africa but did not take hold
in the UK.
<p>A later approach that acknowledged the influence of Jaques but not Paterson was developed at
Unilever. As described by Dive (2004) the notion of broad-banding was rejected and a &lsquo;work
level&rsquo; structure was introduced. The process was called &lsquo;the decision-making accountability</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 247
<p>This level contains those roles in which decision making
extends over a few days or weeks and the work is fairly well
patterned, involving people working individually.

<p>Decision making tends to involve tasks with a time span of

with strategic direction and turning corporate strategies into

ments, namely: expected work, resources, problem solving, change, lateral teams, environ-
ment and task horizon. As Dive explained, DMA &lsquo;concentrates on the added value of decisions
taken&rsquo;. Its key premise is that: &lsquo;Job holders must take decisions that cannot be taken at a lower
level and which need not be taken at a higher level.&rsquo; He emphasized that using DMA is a way
of developing a healthy organization. It is not just a method of grading jobs.
<p>Applications of levelling
<p>When it is used simply as a means of defining pay structures, &lsquo;levelling&rsquo; could be regarded as
no more than another name for job evaluation. But it is more meaningful when the focus is on
the organizational, career mapping and IT applications mentioned above. Defining an organ-
ization structure in levels may express the philosophy of a business about how it should be
organized and the career steps that are available to its people.
<p>In practice, levelling uses established job evaluation techniques such as analytical matching
or job classification and may be underpinned by point-factor rating. It makes a decision on
the number of levels required, which could be based on a ranking exercise using either
point-factor scheme scores or whole-job ranking. Alternatively, an a priori decision may be </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>248 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>made on the number of levels needed by a study of the organization structure, which may
be supported by a role profiling exercise. This decision may be amended later after the level
structure has been tested.
<p>Levels may be defined in terms of job evaluation factors or a selection of them. Sometimes
only a single descriptor is used. In cases where the focus is on career mapping as well as or
instead of pay determination, the level definitions or profiles may be defined in ways that
clearly establish the career ladder, often in a job family (ie a group of jobs in which the nature
of the work will be similar but it is carried out at different levels). The definition may express
what people are expected to know and be able to do at each level (technical competencies) and
may refer to behavioural competencies. The aim is to produce a clear hierarchy of levels that
will ease the process of allocating roles to levels and define career progression steps in and
between families.
<p>Job analysis for job evaluation
<p>The reliability and validity of job evaluation depends largely on the quality of the analysis of
jobs that provides the factual information in the form of job descriptions upon which the eval-
uation is based.
<p>Existing job descriptions are seldom any use for job evaluation because they are generally
limited simply to listing tasks or duties and do not cover the demands made on people in their
roles. Further analysis is almost always necessary and there is a choice of methods as described
below, namely: written questionnaires, structured interviews or computer-aided interviews.
When developing a scheme, it may be worth trialling more than one method.
<p>Written questionnaires
<p>Embarking on a complete re-write of the organization&rsquo;s job descriptions could be a formida-
ble and time-consuming task. Instead a questionnaire may be used, with a commitment to
review the design of job descriptions or role profiles on completion of the job evaluation
project, using the information drawn from the questionnaires.
<p>Questionnaires ask for narrative responses to questions that relate to each factor in the scheme.
They may be given to employees for completion on the basis that they know best how the job
is done, or to the line manager, or, ideally, to both as a shared task.
<p>Structured interviews
<p>Alternatively, questionnaires can be used as the basis for a structured interview with job
holders &ndash; either directly sharing the questionnaire with the job holders, or using an interview </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 249
<p>guide based on the questionnaire, administered by job analysts. The results of the interview
are then written up in full after the interview. Sharing a questionnaire with job holders can
increase the transparency of the process if it is given to job holders either before or during the
interview.
<p>Computer-aided analysis
<p>Interactive computer-aided systems, as described later, use a set of online questions. The
answers are converted into a job profile.
<p>Job descriptions
<p>The job descriptions resulting from the analysis contain information about the job&rsquo;s place in
the organization structure followed by a definition of its overall purpose, a list of key result
areas and an analysis of the job demands in terms of each of the factors in the scheme. An
example is given in Figure 16.5.
<p>Computer-aided job evaluation
<p>Computer-aided job evaluation uses computer software to convert information about jobs
into a job evaluation score or grade. It is generally underpinned by a conventional point-factor
scheme. The &lsquo;proprietary brands&rsquo; offered by consultants are often computer-aided. Comput-
ers may be used simply to maintain a database that records evaluations and their rationale. In
the design stage they can provide guidance on weighting factors through multiple regression
analysis, although this technique has been largely discredited and is little used now.
<p>Methodology
<p>The software used in a fully computer-aided scheme essentially replicates in digital form the
thought processes followed by evaluators when conducting a &lsquo;manual&rsquo; evaluation. It is based
on defined evaluation decision rules built into the system shell. The software typically provides
a facility for consistency checks by, for example, highlighting scoring differences between the
job being evaluated and other benchmark jobs.
<p>The two types of computer-aided evaluation are:
<p>Schemes in which the job analysis data is either entered direct into the computer or &bull;
transferred to it from a paper questionnaire. The computer software applies pre-
determined rules to convert the data into scores for each factor and produce a total
score. This is the most common approach.</p>

<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 251
<p>Interactive computer-aided schemes in which the job holder and his or her manager sit &bull;
in front of a PC and are presented with a series of logically interrelated questions, the
answers to which lead to a score for each of the built in factors in turn and a total
score.
<p>The case for computer-aided job evaluation
<p>A computer-aided scheme can achieve greater consistency than when a panel of evaluators
uses a paper scheme. With the help of the computer the same input information gives the
same output result, which is not always the case with a panel. It can also increase the speed of
evaluations, reduce the resources required and provide facilities for sorting, analysing, report-
ing on the input information and system outputs, and record keeping (database).
<p>The case against computer-aided job evaluation
<p>For some organizations the full approach is too expensive and elaborate a process. Others do
not want to abandon the involvement of employees and their representatives in the traditional
panel approach. There is also the problem of transparency in some applications. This is some-
times called &lsquo;the black box effect&rsquo; &ndash; those concerned have difficulty in understanding the logic
that converts the input information to a factor level score. Interactive systems such as those
offered by Pilat Consultants (Gauge) and Watson Wyatt aim to overcome this difficulty.
<p>It is perhaps for these reasons that fewer than half the respondents to the 2007 e-reward survey
had computer-aided schemes, and over half of those used computers simply to maintain job
evaluation records.
<p>Choice of approach
<p>The fundamental choice is between using formal or informal methods of valuing jobs. This
may not be a conscious decision. A company may use informal methods simply because that&rsquo;s
what it has always done and because it never occurs to its management that there is an alterna-
tive. But it may decide deliberately that an informal or semi-formal approach fits its circum-
stances best.
<p>If it is decided that a formal or semi-formal approach is required, the advantages and disad-
vantages of each approach as summarized in Table 16.1 need to be considered, examined in
the light of criteria for choice (such as those set out below) and compared with the objectives
of the scheme and the context in which it will be used.</p>

<p>254 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Criteria for choice
<p>The following are the criteria to be used in making a choice:
<p>Thorough in analysis and capable of impartial application: the scheme should have &bull;
been carefully constructed to ensure that its methodology is sound and appropriate in
terms of all the jobs it has to cater for. It should also have been tested and trialled to
check that it can be applied impartially to those jobs.
<p>Appropriate: it should cater for the particular demands made on all the jobs to be &bull;
covered by the scheme.
<p>Comprehensive: the scheme should be applicable to all the jobs in the organization &bull;
covering all categories of staff, and if factors are used they should be common to all
those jobs. There should therefore be a single scheme that can be used to assess rela-
tivities across different occupations or job families and to enable benchmarking to take
place as required.
<p>Transparent: the processes used in the scheme from the initial role analysis through to &bull;
the grading decision should be clear to all concerned. If computers are used, informa-
tion should not be perceived as being processed in a &lsquo;black box&rsquo;.
<p>Non-discriminatory: the scheme should meet requirements relating to equal pay for &bull;
work of equal value.
<p>Ease of administration: the scheme should not be too complex or time consuming to &bull;
design or implement.
<p>The decision may be to use one approach, for example point-factor rating or analytical match-
ing. But an increasing number of organizations are combining the two: using point-factor
rating to evaluate a representative sample of bench mark jobs (ie jobs that can be used as
points of comparison for other jobs) and, to save time and trouble, evaluating the remaining
jobs by means of analytical matching.
<p>Making the choice
<p>The overwhelming preference for analytical schemes shown by the e-reward 2007 survey sug-
gests that the choice is fairly obvious. The advantages of using a recognized analytical approach
that satisfies equal value requirements appear to be overwhelming. Point-factor schemes were
used by 70 per cent of the respondents and others used analytical matching, often in conjunc-
tion with the points scheme.
<p>There is much to be said for adopting point-factor methodology as the main scheme but using
analytical matching in a supporting role to deal with large numbers of generic roles not covered
in the original benchmarking exercise. Analytical matching can be used to allocate generic </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 255
<p>roles to grades as part of the normal job evaluation procedure to avoid having to resort to job
evaluation in every case. The tendency in many organizations is to assign to job evaluation a
supporting role of this nature rather than allowing it to dominate all grading decisions and
thus involve the expenditure of much time and energy.
<p>Developing a point-factor job evaluation scheme
<p>Point-factor job evaluation schemes as described on page 238 are the most popular type of
scheme. The sequence of activities required to develop one is shown in Figure 16.6.
<p>Step 1: Set up the project
Establish project team
<p>It is highly desirable to set up a project team to oversee and take part in the project. The team
should include representatives of line management and staff. Technical support can be pro-
vided by HR, possibly with the help of outside consultants. The support will include the
detailed work of job analysis and developing and testing factor plans.

<p>256 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Draw up project plan
<p>A project plan should be prepared in as much detail as possible. This will provide the basis for
managing the project. A plan set out as a bar chart is illustrated in Figure 16.7.
<p>Formulate communications strategy
<p>Job evaluation schemes can arouse intense suspicion, even fear. It is essential to have a strategy
for communicating information about the scheme to allay these suspicions and fears. The
strategy should be developed in consultation with the project team, who may well be involved
in the communication process. The strategy should cover what should be communicated, who
it should be communicated to and how it should be communicated. A checklist of the major
points that might be included in the communications strategy is set out in Figure 16.8.
<p>Step 2: Design factor plan
<p>A factor plan is a matrix consisting of a number of factors (a factor is a criterion for judging the
value of a job in one particular aspect or characteristic of the work involved), which are divided
into a number of scored levels that can be used to determine the extent to which the factor is
present in a job. The process of developing a basic factor plan involves the following steps:
<p>1. Identify and define factors.
<p>2. Decide on the number of levels for each factor and define them.
<p>3. Decide on the scoring system to be used.

<p>4. Decide whether or not to have explicit weighting (this takes place when some factors are
regarded as more important and are therefore allocated a higher range of points scores
than others).
<p>Select and define factors
<p>A factor is a criterion for judging the value of a job in one particular aspect or characteristic of
the work involved. The 2007 e-reward job evaluation survey established that the respondents&rsquo;
schemes had between 3 and 14 factors, the average number being five. Guidelines on the selec-
tion of factors are given in Table 16.2, and guidelines on defining factor levels are given in
Table 16.3.
<p>Decide on scoring system
<p>The next step is to decide on the scoring system. Each level in the factor plan has to be allo-
cated a points value so that there is a scoring progression from the lowest to the highest level.
A decision needs to be made on how to set the scoring progression within each factor.
<p>There are two methods. First, the arithmetic or linear approach assumes that there are consistent
step differences between factor levels &ndash; for example, a five-level factor might be scored 10, 20, 30,
40 and 50. Alternatively, geometric scoring assumes that there are larger score differences at each </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>258 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Table 16.2 Guidelines for selecting factors
<p>1. The factors must be capable of identifying relevant and important differences between
jobs that will support the creation of a rank order of the jobs to be covered by the
scheme.
<p>2. The factors should between them measure all significant job features and should be of
broadly comparable scope.
<p>3. The factors should reflect the values of the organization.
<p>4. They should apply equally well to different types of work, including specialists and gen-
eralists, lower-level and higher-level jobs, and not be biased in favour of one gender or
group.
<p>5. The whole range of jobs to be evaluated at all levels should be covered without favouring
men or women, people belonging to a particular racial group, different age groups or
any particular job or occupation.
<p>6. The scheme should fairly measure features of female-dominated jobs as well as male-
dominated ones.
<p>7. The choice should not lead to discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, disability,
religion, age or any other reason. Experience should not be included as a factor because
it could be discriminatory either on the grounds of gender or age. The same principle
applies to education or qualifications as stand-alone factors.
<p>8. Job features frequently found in jobs carried out mainly by one gender should not be
omitted, for example, manual dexterity, interpersonal skills and &lsquo;caring&rsquo; responsibili-
ties. However, if such features are included, it is important that the scheme captures the
range of skills across all jobs, including those that might be dominated by another
gender.
<p>9. Double counting should be avoided; in other words, each factor must be independent
of every other factor &ndash; the more factors (or sub-factors) in the plan, the higher the prob-
ability that double counting will take place.
<p>10. Elision or compression of more than one significant job feature under a single factor
heading should be avoided. If important factors are compressed with others, it means
that they could be undervalued.
<p>11. The factor definitions should be clear, relevant and understandable, and written in a
way that is meaningful to those who will use the scheme.
<p>12. The factors should be acceptable to those who will be covered by the scheme.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 259
<p>Table 16.3 Guidelines on defining factor levels
<p>1. Consider the number of levels (often four, five, six or seven) that may be needed to
reflect the range of responsibilities and demands in the jobs covered by the scheme.
<p>2. Analyse what would characterize the highest or lowest level for each factor and how
these should be described.
<p>3. Decide provisionally on the number of levels (say three) between the highest and lowest
level so that the level structure reflects the graduation in responsibilities or demands.
(This decision could be amended following the process of defining levels, which might
reveal that more or fewer levels are required.)
<p>4. Define each level as clearly as possible to help evaluators make &lsquo;best fit&rsquo; decisions when
they compare role data with level definitions.
<p>5. Ensure that the levels should cover the whole range of demands in this factor that are
likely to arise in the jobs with which the evaluation scheme is concerned.
<p>6. Relate the content of level definitions to the definition of the factor concerned and
ensure that it does not overlap with other factors.
<p>7. Ensure that the factor levels represent clear and recognizable steps in demand.
<p>8. Provide for uniform progression in the definitions level by level from the lowest to the
highest level. There should be no gaps or undefined intermediate levels that might lead
to evaluators finding it difficult to be confident about the allocation of a level of
demand.
<p>9. Define levels in absolute, not relative terms. So far as possible any dimensions should be
defined. They should not rely upon a succession of undefined comparatives, eg small,
medium, large.
<p>10. Ensure that each level definition stands on its own. Level definitions should not be
defined by reference to a lower or higher level; in other words, it is insufficient to define
a level in words to the effect that it is a higher (or lower) version of an adjacent level.
<p>successive level in the hierarchy to reflect progressive increases in responsibility. Thus the levels
may be scored 10, 20, 35, 55 and 80. This increases the scoring differentiation between higher-
level jobs. The e-reward 2007 job evaluation survey found that 73 per cent of respondents used
the geometric model in their schemes. An example of a geometrically scored outline unweighted
factor plan is given in Table 16.4.</p>

<p>Responsibility for resources 15 40* 70 116 160
<p>Decide whether or not to weight the factors
<p>Weighting recognizes that there are differences in the importance of factors by allocating more
or less points to them. The choice is first between weighting or not weighting factors. Only 19
per cent of the schemes of the e-reward 2007 survey respondents were unweighted. This
reflects the view of the majority of people that some factors must be more important than
others.
<p>The most common but highly judgemental approach to decide on weighting is for the project
team to discuss and agree subjective views on which factors are more important and arbitrar-
ily allocate additional points or extra levels to them. A typical method of deciding on explicit
weighting (ie extra points) is to get each member of the team to distribute 100 points amongst
the factors; these are then revealed to the whole team, which reaches an agreement on the most
acceptable distribution. This discussion may be expected to take account of guiding principles
such as that no factor will have a weighting of less than 5 per cent or more than 30 per cent.
<p>It is common practice to defer the final weighting decision until the unweighted factor plan
has been tested. This test may reveal whether or not weighting is required.
<p>The factor plan should not discriminate on the grounds of gender, race or disability. Guide-
lines on the factors to be considered are given in Chapter 17, Table 17.1.
<p>Step 3: Test factor plan and decide on computerization
<p>To test the factor plan it is necessary first to select, analyse and describe a representative sample
of test jobs and then to evaluate the jobs, using the draft factor plan that may have been scored
but is not yet weighted if it has been decided to defer a weighting decision. The aim of the test
is to check on the extent to which:
<p>The factors are appropriate. &bull;
<p>Level definitions are worded clearly and graduated properly. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 261
<p>Level definitions provide good guidance on the allocation of factor levels to evaluators &bull;
and thus enable consistent evaluations to be made.
<p>As far as can be judged, the evaluation produces a valid result. &bull;
<p>Whether or not weighting is required (if a decision has been deferred). &bull;
<p>Following the test, the factor plan can be revised and a decision on weighting made. This will
produce the final &lsquo;paper&rsquo; plan, but consideration at this stage can be given to the possibility of
introducing computer-aided evaluation. (The two types of computer evaluation are described
in the section on Methodology, page 249.)
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of computer-aided evaluation are set out in Table 16.5.
<p>Step 4: Roll out job evaluation
<p>To roll out job evaluation it is necessary to:
<p>identify, analyse and evaluate benchmark jobs; &bull;
<p>design grade structure; &bull;
<p>develop analytical matching process; &bull;
<p>define operating procedures; &bull;
<p>grade remaining jobs. &bull;

<br>
<p>262 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Identify, analyse and evaluate benchmark jobs
<p>The final paper or computer-aided scheme is used to evaluate benchmark jobs. These are
typical jobs that represent the different occupations and levels of work in an organization and
are used as points of reference with which other jobs can be compared and evaluated. The
evaluated benchmark jobs provide the basis for designing a grade structure and are used in
analytical matching as described below. They will include the test jobs but it may be necessary
to select additional ones to provide a sufficient number for designing a grade structure.
<p>Design grade structure
<p>The information on the benchmark job evaluation can be used to design a grade structure as
described in the next section of this chapter. Grades may be defined in terms of a range of
points scores. Additionally the grades may be defined descriptively in the form of grade pro-
files as a basis for using analytical matching to speed up the processes of grading the remaining
jobs and of maintaining the grading system by grading or regrading new or changed jobs after
the initial exercise.
<p>Develop analytical matching process
<p>Analytical matching involves matching jobs to be evaluated on a factor-by-factor basis either
with analytical grade definitions (grade profiles) or analytical job descriptions for benchmark
posts (role profiles). It will be necessary to ensure that the grade profiles are defined in terms
of the job evaluation factors. It will also be necessary to define a protocol for analytical match-
ing that specifies:
<p>what constitutes a perfect match, ie where all the elements in the role profile match all &bull;
the elements in the grade or benchmark role profile;
<p>the number of matches of individual elements required to indicate that a profile match &bull;
is justified, for example 6 out of 10; however, it is usual to restrict the mismatches
allowed to fairly small variations &ndash; if there are any large ones, the match would be
invalidated;
<p>any elements that must match for there to be a profile match (for example it may be &bull;
decided that there must be a match for an element covering knowledge and skills);
<p>the procedure for grading if there has been a mismatch (this may specify a full evalua- &bull;
tion of the role if the matching process is using the point-factor analytical scheme).
<p>Define operating procedures
<p>These will cover how jobs should be analysed and evaluated, including who is responsible, the
basis upon which requests for re-evaluation can be made and the appeals procedure. The pro-</p>
<br>

<p>cedures should be set out and operated to ensure that there is no bias or discrimination on the
grounds of gender, race or disability. Guidelines on avoiding discrimination are given in
Chapter 17, Table 17.1.
<p>Grade remaining jobs
<p>The analytical matching procedure is used to grade the jobs not covered in the benchmark
evaluation exercise.
<p>Job evaluation: six tips
Keep it simple: minimize paperwork and avoid bureaucracy. &bull;
<p>Involve managers, other employees and employee representatives in the choice &bull;
of scheme and its design and operation.
<p>Use an analytical approach: analytical job matching underpinned by a point- &bull;
factor scheme.
<p>Ensure it fits the context of the business: culture, type of work and people. &bull;
<p>Keep everyone informed on how it works and how it affects them. &bull;
<p>Ensure that the design of the scheme and the process of operating it does not &bull;
involve any form of discrimination or bias.

<p>Introduction
<p>In 1970 the difference between the earnings of men and women in the UK (the gender pay
gap) was 37.9 per cent. Pay inequality between men and women in the UK is not so blatant
now since the 1970 Equal Pay Act, the efforts of the Equal Opportunities Commission (now
the Equality and Human Rights Commission) and a proliferation of reports &ndash; the 2001
Kingsmill Review of Women&rsquo;s Employment and Pay, the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research (NIESR) (2001), the Task Force on Equal Pay (2001) and the Women and

<p>Work Commission (2006). But in spite of all this effort there is still a significant gender gap.
The government&rsquo;s 2008 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ONS, 2008) revealed that the
gap between the hourly earnings for full-time men and women was 17.1 per cent. This was the
same as in 2005. So no recent progress has been made in reducing it, although it has declined
a little from 21.2 per cent in 1998. One of the reasons for this slight narrowing of the gap has
been the national minimum wage, which helped part-time women who had formerly been
paid an hourly rate that was below that of their full-time male comparators.
<p>As Robert Elliott (1991) commented: &lsquo;Discrimination arises when equals are treated une-
qually.&rsquo; Historically, it has been generally accepted by men in a man&rsquo;s world that women&rsquo;s
place was in the home, unless they were needed to carry out menial and therefore underpaid
jobs. Women&rsquo;s work has been undervalued because of the low rates of pay. It has been a
vicious circle. Prior to the Equal Pay Act, collective agreements tended to have only one rate of
pay for women workers, with no differentiation between grades of work or levels of skill.
<p>The entry of women into the professions in the 19th century and pressures for women&rsquo;s rights
in the 20th heralded a very gradual change in this climate of discrimination. But it needed the
Treaty of Rome (1957), Article 179 of which enshrined the principle of equal pay for equal
work, to stimulate anti-discriminatory law in the United Kingdom. The first British legislation
was the Equal Pay Act of 1970, amended by the Equal Pay Amendment Regulations in 1983.
<p>The persistence of the gender pay gap in spite of this legislation is wrong in principle but also
damaging in practice. As Denise Kingsmill wrote in her 2001 Review of Women&rsquo;s Employment
and Pay:
<p>I am convinced that the scale and persistence of the gender pay gap in Britain reflects a
failure in human capital management that is neither good for the economy nor in the
interests of the majority of employers or employees. The need to address issues of
women&rsquo;s employment and pay is not just a matter of creating a society in which men
and women have equal opportunities and are equally valued for the contribution they
make, important though these are. It is also a matter of making the best use of the full
range of human capital to promote economic growth.
<p>Any steps to tackle this problem must be based on an understanding of the causes of pay dis-
crimination and these are analysed in the first section of this chapter. The major, but not
hugely successful, instrument for dealing with it in the UK has been the UK legislation on
equal pay, which is described in the second section of the chapter. The final sections cover the
steps that can be taken to achieve equality, manage the risks of successful equal pay claims and
defend claims.</p>

<p>266 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Reasons for unequal pay
<p>In an analysis of the economics of equal pay for work of equal value, Rubery (1992) sug-
gested that the undervaluation of women&rsquo;s employment is caused by three interrelated
factors: 1) gender discrimination in the ways in which jobs are graded and paid, 2) wide-
spread occupational segregation by gender, and 3) differences in the labour supply and
labour market conditions that allow the differences to be perpetuated. A further reason was
given in the report of the Equal Pay Task Force (2001), namely, the unequal impact of
women&rsquo;s family responsibilities.
<p>Comprehensive research conducted by the NIESR (2001) into the causes of the gender pay gap
identified the following five key factors:
<p>Human capital differences: differences in educational levels and work experience. His- &bull;
torical differences in the levels of qualifications held by men and women have contrib-
uted to the pay gap. Women are still more likely than men to have breaks from paid
work to care for children and other dependents. These breaks impact on women&rsquo;s level
of work experience, which in turn impacts on their pay rates.
<p>Part-time working: the pay gap between women&rsquo;s part-time hourly earnings and men&rsquo;s &bull;
full-time hourly earnings is particularly large and, because so many women work part
time, this is a major contributor to the gender pay gap. Some of this gap is due to part-
time workers having lower levels of qualifications and less work experience. However,
it is also due to part-time work being concentrated in less well-paid occupations.
<p>Occupational segregation: women&rsquo;s work is highly concentrated in certain occupations &bull;
(60 per cent of working women work in just 10 occupations). And the occupations that
are female-dominated are often the lowest paid. In addition, women are still underrep-
resented in the higher-paid jobs within occupations &ndash; the &lsquo;glass ceiling&rsquo; effect.
<p>Workplace segregation: at the level of individual workplaces, high concentrations of &bull;
female employees are associated with relatively low rates of pay. And higher levels of
part-time working are associated with lower rates of pay, even after other factors have
been taken into account.
<p>Travel patterns: on average women spend less time commuting than men. This may be &bull;
because of time constraints due to balancing work and caring responsibilities. This can
impact on women&rsquo;s work in two ways: a smaller range of jobs to choose from and/or
lots of women wanting work in the same location (ie near to or where they live), which
leads to lower wages for these jobs.
<p>Other factors that affect the gender pay gap include: job grading practices, appraisal systems,
reward systems, retention measures, career breaks, poor union representation and wage setting
practices. In the latter case, wage levels set entirely on the basis of external comparisons (market </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Equal Pay 267
<p>rates) can lead to unequal pay for women within the organization simply because external
rates reflect the pay inequities already existing in the labour market.
<p>The design and operation of pay structures can contribute to maintaining or even enlarging
the pay gap. For example, experienced men with skills that, because of unequal opportunities,
women do not have to the same extent, may be started at higher rates of pay within a pay range
for the job. It is said that men are better at negotiating higher rates of pay for themselves,
although there is no supporting evidence for this.
<p>Extended pay ranges, especially where progression is based on length of service, will favour
men, who are much less likely than women to have career breaks and may therefore progress
further and faster. The assimilation of men on their present higher rates of pay in the upper
reaches of new pay ranges may leave women behind and they may take a long time to catch
up, if they ever do. Broad-banded pay structures, as described in Chapter 19, can also lead
to discrimination.
<p>It is noteworthy that none of the key factors identified by the NIESR research refers specifically
to pay inequities as a cause of the gender pay gap. Indeed, Diana Kingsmill (2001) commented
that: &lsquo;Unlawful wage inequality &ndash; the occurrence of unequal pay&hellip; does not appear to be as
commonplace as the 18 per cent headline gap would suggest.&rsquo; This opinion seems to be backed
up in part by the 2001 report of the Equal Pay Task Force, which stated that in their view, pay
discrimination contributed to 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the pay gap &ndash; a wide range that
seems to be matter of opinion rather than evidence.
<p>The Kingsmill Review focused mainly on the other factors creating the pay gap and Diana
Kingsmill commented that: &lsquo;Time and time again I have been confronted with data demonstrat-
ing that women are clustered towards the bottom of organizational hierarchies while men are
clustered towards the top. This distribution clearly has a profound impact on the pay gap.&rsquo;
<p>The pay gap may have decreased slightly in recent years but it is still unacceptable. However,
dealing with it is difficult. The equal pay legislation described below has had some effect, but
it cannot deal with reasons for the pay gap that are not associated with unequal base rates of
pay, such as part-time working, occupational segregation, workplace segregation or career
breaks resulting in gaps in pay progression and starting rates for women.
<p>These are complex issues and they are more difficult to cope with than relatively straightfor-
ward unequal base rates for like work. Increases in the National Minimum Wage have helped
but are not enough. It will take radical changes in the ways that women are employed and their
pay is managed (pay on starting a job or following promotion, and pay progression) to make
a real difference. That will take time and a lot of effort that will not be forthcoming voluntarily
in many organizations. But this does not detract from the need to deal with pay inequities. The
next section of this chapter therefore concentrates on the equal pay legislation and how it
affects pay policy and practice.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>268 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>The equal pay legal framework
<p>The equal pay for work of equal value legal framework is based on the provisions of European
legislation, the 1970 Equal Pay Act as amended by the Equal Pay (Amendment) Regulations
1983, and case law. The legislation essentially provides that pay differences are allowable only
if the reason for them is not related to the sex of the job holder. The Act and its amendment
are implemented through employment tribunals. The Employment Act 2002 provided for the
use of equal pay questionnaires.
<p>The same principles of fairness and equity of course apply to other potential areas of dis-
crimination, and although the rest of this chapter focuses on the equal pay legislation and
its impact, it is also concerned with the conduct of equal pay reviews designed to identify
any aspects of discrimination related to race, religion, disability or age that results in pay
inequities.
<p>European legislation
<p>Article 119 of the EC founding Treaty of Rome of 1957 (now subsumed and expanded as
Article 142 of the Treaty of Maastricht) stated that men and women should receive equal pay
for equal work &ndash; in order to establish what is often described as a &lsquo;level playing field&rsquo; in terms
of wages. Article 119 was extended by the Equal Pay Directive of 1975, which stated that:
<p>Men and women should receive equal pay for work of equal value. &bull;
<p>Job classification systems (which is Euro-English for any formal grading systems and &bull;
thus encompasses job evaluation schemes) should be fair and non-discriminatory.
<p>EC member states should take steps to implement the equal pay principle. &bull;
<p>The Equal Pay Act 1970
<p>The 1970 Equal Pay Act effectively outlawed separate women&rsquo;s rates of pay by introducing an
implied equality clause into all contracts of employment. Under the Act, which came into
force in 1975, an employee in the United Kingdom is entitled to claim pay equal to that of an
employee of the opposite sex in the same employing organization in only two situations:
<p>where they are doing the same, or broadly similar work (often termed &lsquo;like work&rsquo;); &bull;
<p>where the work they do is rated equivalent under a job evaluation scheme. &bull;
<p>The basis of the Act is that every contract of employment is deemed to contain an equality
clause that is triggered in either situation. The equality clause modifies any terms in a woman&rsquo;s
contract that are less favourable than those of the male comparator. Thus, if a woman is paid
less than a man doing the same work, she is entitled to be upgraded to the same rate of pay.
Although the Act refers to pay, it extends to all aspects of the employee benefits package.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Equal Pay 269
<p>The three important points to note about the original Act are that:
<p>Because it was confined to like work and work rated as equivalent, the scope of com- &bull;
parison was fairly narrow.
<p>It did not make job evaluation compulsory, but did establish the important point (or &bull;
made the important assumption) that where job evaluation did exist and valued two
jobs equally, there was a prima facie entitlement to equal pay.
<p>It recognized that a job evaluation scheme could be discriminatory if it set &lsquo;different &bull;
values for men and women on the same demand under any heading&rsquo;. It gave effort, skill
and decision as examples of headings.
<p>However, the European Commission&rsquo;s Equal Pay Directive of 1975 stated that the principle
of equal pay should be applied to work of equal value. The Commission successfully argued
before the European Court of Justice in 1982 that the United Kingdom had failed to imple-
ment the directive, because the Equal Pay Act enabled individuals to obtain equal pay for
work of equal value only where their employer had implemented job evaluation. As a result
the United Kingdom government had to introduce the 1983 Equal Pay (Amendment) Regu-
lations of the Act, which came into force in 1984. These are often referred to as the equal
value regulations.
<p>The Equal Pay (Amendment) Regulations 1983
<p>Under this equal value amendment women are entitled to the same pay as men (and vice
versa) where the work is of equal value &lsquo;in terms of the demands made on a worker under
various headings, for instance, effort, skill, decision&rsquo;.
<p>This removed the barrier built into the Act that had prevented women claiming equal pay
where they were employed in women&rsquo;s jobs and no men were employed in the same work.
Now any woman could claim equal pay with any man and vice versa, subject to the rules about
being in the same employment. Equal value claims can be brought even if there are no job
evaluation arrangements, although the existence of a non-discriminatory and analytical job
evaluation scheme that has been applied properly to indicate that the jobs in question are not
of equal value can be a defence in an equal value case.
<p>The amendment also provided for the assignment of &lsquo;independent experts&rsquo; by employment
tribunals to assess equality of value between claimant and comparator under such headings as
effort, skill and decision without regard to the cost or the industrial relations consequences of
a successful claim.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>270 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Employment Act 2002
<p>One of the biggest barriers to bringing equal pay claims has been a lack of access to informa-
tion regarding other people&rsquo;s pay. The Equal Pay (Questions and Replies) Order 2003 of the
Employment Act 2002 provided for an Equal Pay questionnaire that can be used by an
employee to request information from their employer about whether their remuneration is
equal to that of named colleagues. Unions may also lodge these forms on behalf of their
members.
<p>The questionnaire includes:
<p>A statement of why the individual (the complainant) thinks they are not receiving &bull;
equal pay, followed by a statement of who they believe the comparators are. A compa-
rator is the person the complainant is comparing themselves with. Complainants can
compare themselves with a predecessor or successor in the job. The comparator must
be in the same employment as the complainant.
<p>Factual questions to ascertain whether the complainant is receiving less pay than the &bull;
comparator and, if so, the reason why.
<p>A question asking whether the employer (the respondent) agrees or disagrees (with &bull;
reasons) that the complainant is being paid less than the comparator.
<p>A question asking whether the employer agrees or disagrees (with reasons) that the &bull;
complainant and the comparator are doing equal work.
<p>Space for the complainant&rsquo;s own questions. &bull;
<p>The employer is asked to respond within eight weeks but is not required to reply to the com-
plainant&rsquo;s questions. However, if the employer fails without reasonable excuse to reply within
eight weeks or replies in &lsquo;an evasive or ambiguous way&rsquo;, the Employment Tribunal may con-
clude that a respondent did not provide a proper explanation for a difference in pay because
there was no genuine reason for the difference.
<p>The Gender Equality Duty 2007
<p>The Gender Equality Duty places a legal responsibility on public authorities in England, Scot-
land and Wales to promote gender equality, eliminate sex discrimination and demonstrate
that they treat men and women fairly.
<p>Case law
<p>The following are some of the leading cases that provide guidance in a number of areas as indi-
cated on how the equal pay legislation should be applied in a number of areas.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Equal Pay 271
<p>The basis of comparison
<p>In the case of Hayward v. Cammell Laird (1988) the House of Lords ruled that the Act required
a comparison of each term of the contract considered in isolation. The applicant was therefore
entitled to the same rates of basic and overtime pay as the comparator even though the other
terms of her contract were more favourable.
<p>The definition of pay
<p>In Barber v. Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance Group (1990) the European Court of Justice
held that occupational pensions under a contracted-out pensions scheme constitute &lsquo;pay&rsquo;
under Article 119 and so must be offered to men and women on equal terms.
<p>Extended pay scales
<p>In Crossley v. ACAS (1999) the applicant claimed that she was doing work of equal value to the
comparator but earned significantly less due to the fact that the ACAS pay scales required
many years experience to reach the top of the pay band. This, it was argued, discriminated
against women, who are more likely to have shorter periods of service. Although the Tribunal
accepted that there was a period during which the job was being learnt, it agreed the period in
this case was too long.
<p>In Cadman v. the Health and Safety Executive (2006) The European Court ruled that pay could be
related to service but might have to be objectively justified by demonstrating that longer service
results in skills necessary to do a higher job. This means that employers can be challenged by
women if the latter can provide evidence that longer service does not lead to better performance.
<p>Market forces
<p>In Enderby v. Frenchay Health Authority (1993) the European Court of Justice ruled that &lsquo;the
state of the employment market, which may lead an employer to increase the pay of a particu-
lar job in order to attract candidates, may constitute an objectively justified ground&rsquo; for a dif-
ference in pay. But tribunals will want clear evidence that a market forces material factor
defence is based on &lsquo;objectively justified grounds&rsquo;, bearing in mind that the labour market
generally discriminates against women. They may view with suspicion evidence gleaned only
from published surveys that they may hold to be inherently discriminatory because they simply
represent the status quo.
<p>Red-circling
<p>In Snoxell v. Vauxhall Motors Ltd (1977) it was held that if an employee&rsquo;s pay is not reduced,
ie is &lsquo;protected&rsquo;, following a re-grading exercise when their pay falls above the maximum for
their new grade (red-circling), the protection should not last indefinitely.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>272 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Transparency
<p>In what is usually referred to in abbreviated form as the &lsquo;Danfoss&rsquo; case, the European Court of
Justice in 1989 ruled that:
<p>The Equal Pay Directive must be interpreted as meaning that when an undertaking
applies a pay system which is characterized by a total lack of transparency, the burden
of proof is on the employer to show that his [sic] pay practice is not discriminating
where a female worker has established, by comparison with a relatively large number of
employees, that the average pay of female workers is lower than that of male workers.
<p>Use of job evaluation as a defence in an equal pay claim
<p>In Bromley v. Quick (1988) the Court of Appeal ruled that a job evaluation system can provide
a defence only if it is analytical in nature. The employer must demonstrate the absence of sex
bias in the job evaluation scheme, and jobs will be held to be covered by a job evaluation
scheme only if they have been fully evaluated using the scheme&rsquo;s factors.
<p>Code of Practice on Equal Pay
<p>This code was produced by the Equal Opportunities Commission in 2003. It is not legally
binding but employment tribunals may take into account an employer&rsquo;s failure to act on its
provisions.
<p>Equal pay claims
<p>Claims for equal pay, which may be supported by a completed equal pay questionnaire, can be
made to an employment tribunal on any of the following three grounds:
<p>where the work is like work, meaning the same or very similar work; &bull;
<p>where the work is rated as equivalent under a job evaluation &lsquo;study&rsquo;; &bull;
<p>where the work is of equal value &lsquo;in terms of the demands made on a worker under &bull;
various headings, for instance, effort, skill, decision&rsquo;.
<p>The person making the claim &ndash; the applicant &ndash; must find a comparator who is a person of the
opposite gender doing like, equivalent or equal value work who is paid more or has more ben-
eficial terms and conditions of employment than the applicant.
<p>If a tribunal finds that the work is like, equivalent or of equal value it can invoke the equality
clause in the legislation and rule that the man and the woman should be paid the same.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Equal Pay 273
<p>Achieving equal pay
<p>The achievement of equal pay is a matter of eliminating discrimination or bias in fixing rates
of pay. Bear in mind that discrimination can occur on grounds of race, disability, age, sexual
orientation or religious belief as well as between men and women.
<p>The following actions are required to ensure that equal pay is achieved:
<p>Use an analytical job evaluation scheme that is free of bias (see Table 17.1). &bull;
<p>Ensure that discrimination or bias does not occur in operating the job evaluation &bull;
scheme (see Table 17.1).
<p>Design a grade and pay structure that is free of bias. This will cover such issues as dis- &bull;
crimination in placing grade boundaries in the structure and over-extended pay scales
(see Table 17.1).
<p>Ensure that the processes used for grading jobs in the structure are free of bias. &bull;
<p>Check the policy and practice on positioning employees within a pay range in a graded &bull;
pay structure or on a pay point in a pay spine to ensure that bias does not occur (for
example, if men are consistently placed at a higher point in the scale than women on
appointment or promotion without justification in terms of qualifications or experi-
ence, or women returning from maternity leave are not re-entering their pay scale at
the position they would have attained had they not been on leave).
<p>Check the policy and practice on assimilating staff into a new grade and pay structure &bull;
to ensure that one category of staff is not favoured over another.
<p>Check the policy and practice on progressing the pay of staff within a pay structure to &bull;
ensure that no category of staff is progressing faster up a grade or to higher points in a
grade without good reason.
<p>Review policy and practice on upgradings and promotions to ensure that discrimina- &bull;
tion is not taking place, for example between white and Asian employees.
<p>Conduct an equal pay review to establish the extent to which there is inequality in rates &bull;
of pay for work of equal value (eg part-time female workers paid less pro rata than full-
time male workers carrying out like work or work of equal value) and identify the causes
of the inequality, and take action as necessary to deal with any problem (see below).
<p>Ensure that line managers are aware of their responsibility for avoiding pay discrimination. &bull;
<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (2009) in its guidance notes on equal pay also
recommended that there should be only one pay system, which should be transparent and
simple and that any change in the system should be evaluated to ensure that it will not be
discriminatory.</p>

<p>Operating the job evalua-

<p>Design of grade and pay structure
<p>The factors should not be biased in &bull;
favour of one gender or group.
<p>The whole range of jobs to be &bull;
evaluated at all levels should be
covered without favouring men or
women, people belonging to a
particular racial group, different
age groups or any particular job or
occupation.
<p>The scheme should fairly measure &bull;
features of female-dominated jobs
as well as male-dominated jobs.
<p>Experience should not be included &bull;
as a factor because it could be
discriminatory either on the
grounds of gender or age. The same
principle applies to education or
qualifications as stand-alone
factors.
<p>Job features frequently found in &bull;
jobs carried out mainly by one
gender should not be omitted: for
example, manual dexterity,
interpersonal skills and &lsquo;caring&rsquo;
responsibilities.
<p>Double counting should be &bull;
avoided, ie each factor must be
independent of every other factor
&ndash; the more factors (or sub-factors)
in the plan, the higher the
probability that double counting
will take place.
<p>Elision or compression of more &bull;
than one significant job feature
under a single factor heading
should be avoided. If important
factors are compressed with others,
it means that they could be
undervalued.
<p>The factor definitions should be &bull;
clear, relevant and understandable,
and written in a way that is
meaningful to those who will use
the scheme.
<p>The scheme should be &bull;
transparent; everyone
concerned should know
how it works (the basis
upon which the evaluations
are produced).
<p>Appropriate proportions of &bull;
women, those from ethnic
minorities and people with
disabilities should be
involved in the process of
applying job evaluation.
<p>The quality of role analysis &bull;
should be monitored to
ensure that analyses
produce accurate and
relevant information that
will inform the job
evaluation process and will
not be biased.
<p>Consistency checks should &bull;
be built into operating
procedures.
<p>The outcomes of evalua- &bull;
tions should be examined to
ensure that gender or any
other form of bias has not
occurred.
<p>Particular care is necessary &bull;
to ensure that the outcomes
of job evaluation do not
simply replicate the existing
hierarchy &ndash; it is to be
expected that a job
evaluation exercise will
challenge present
relativities.
<p>All those involved in role &bull;
analysis and job evaluation
should be thoroughly
trained in the operation of
the scheme and in how to
avoid bias.
<p>Grade boundaries should not be &bull;
placed between jobs that have been
evaluated as virtually indistinguish-
able, bearing in mind that the problem
will be most acute if grade boundaries
are placed between traditionally male
and female jobs.
<p>&lsquo;Read-across&rsquo; mechanisms should exist &bull;
between different job families and
occupational groups if they are not all
covered by the same plan.
<p>Market rate comparisons should be &bull;
treated with caution to ensure that
differentials arising from market
forces can be objectively justified.
<p>Male and female employees, those &bull;
who are disabled or those from
different ethnic groups should not be
disadvantaged by the methods used to
adjust their pay following regrading.
<p>A non-discriminatory analytical job &bull;
evaluation system should be used to
define grade boundaries and grade
jobs.
<p>Discriminatory job descriptions &bull;
should not be used as a basis for
designing and managing the structure.
<p>Women&rsquo;s or men&rsquo;s jobs should not &bull;
cluster respectively at the higher and
lower levels in the grade of the
hierarchy.
<p>Any variation between pay levels for &bull;
men and women in similarly evaluated
jobs (for example for market rate
reasons) should be objectively
justified.
<p>Red-circling should be free of sex bias. &bull;
Objectively justifiable reasons should &bull;
exist for any inconsistency in the
relation of the grading of jobs in the
structure to job evaluation results.</p>

<p>Equal Pay 275
<p>Risk assessment
<p>Some organizations in low-risk situations may be convinced that they are doing enough about
ensuring equal pay without introducing job evaluation. Others have decided that because their
business imperatives are pressing they are prepared to accept a measure of risk in their policy
on equal pay. Some, regrettably, may not care. But if there is medium or high risk then action
needs to be taken to minimize it. Successful equal pay claims can be hugely expensive, espe-
cially in UK public sector organizations with powerful and active trade unions. Equal pay risk
management may therefore involve using a non-discriminatory job evaluation scheme and
following the prescriptions for achieving equal pay set out above.
<p>The 2007 e-reward survey of job evaluation established that only 52 per cent of respondents
had an analytical job evaluation scheme. The 2009 CIPD reward survey found that 52 per cent
of respondents have already carried out or are planning an equal pay review. The remaining
48 per cent have not, nor do they have plans to do so. There are variations by sector, with
manufacturing firms more resistant to reviews (60 per cent) and public sector organizations
least resistant (20 per cent). A review had been completed by 2008 by 49 per cent of the public
sector organizations and only 14 per cent of the manufacturing firms.
<p>Clearly many organizations have decided that the risk of a claim is negligible. However, it is
unwise simply to assume that there is little or no risk and it is advisable to carry out a risk
assessment so that the organization is aware of the scale of the risk, if any. It can then decide
whether or not to take steps to minimize the risk, such as introducing an analytical job evalu-
ation scheme.
<p>The best way to make this assessment is to carry out a formal equal pay review as described
below. If an organization is unwilling or unable to take this step, it should at least carry out an
analysis of the pay of men and women carrying out like work to identify the existence and
cause of any unjustified differences.
<p>Assessing the risk of a claim also means considering the possibility of individuals initiating
action on their own or trade unions taking action on behalf of their members. Individual
actions may come out of the blue but the person may have raised an equal pay grievance for-
mally or informally, and line managers should understand that they must report this immedi-
ately to HR or senior management. A clear indication of trouble brewing in the UK is when an
employee under the Employment Act 2002 submits an Equal Pay questionnaire to request
information about whether his or her remuneration is equal to that of colleagues. Although
trade unions are most likely to lodge questionnaires on behalf of their members, individuals
can still do so independently by obtaining advice from the EOC (available on their website).
The likelihood of trade union action will clearly be higher when there is a strong union with
high penetration in the organization, which is often the case in the public sector. But any
union member can seek help from her or his union. Even if the union is not recognized for
negotiating purposes it can still provide support.</p>

<p>Equal pay review
<p>The purpose of an equal pay review is to:
<p>establish whether any gender-related pay inequities have arisen; &bull;
<p>analyse the nature of any inequities and diagnose the cause or causes; &bull;
<p>determine what action is required to deal with any inequities that are revealed. &bull;
<p>The three main stages to an equal pay review are:
<p>1. Analysis: the collection and analysis of relevant data to identify any gender gaps.
<p>2. Diagnosis: the process of reviewing gender gaps, understanding why they have occurred
and what remedial action might be required if the differences can not be objectively justi-
fied.
<p>3. Action: agreeing and enacting an action plan that eliminates any inequalities.
<p>Defending an equal pay claim
<p>The two most common grounds for defending a claim are: 1) that the work is not equal, and
2) that even if they are equal, there is a genuine material factor that justifies the difference in
pay as long as the justification is objective. Objective justification has to demonstrate that:
<p>The purpose of the provision or practice is to meet a real business need. &bull;
<p>The provision or practice is appropriate and necessary as a means of meeting that &bull;
need.
<p>Employers cannot defend equal value cases on the grounds of the cost of implementation or
the effect a decision could have on industrial relations, and part-time working per se cannot
provide a defence to a claim. A tribunal can ask an independent expert to analyse the jobs and
report on whether or not they are of equal value.
<p>Note that it is not a defence to a claim to say that a lower hourly rate of pay for one person is
compensated for by, for example, a better annual holiday entitlement. The contracts of the
applicant and the comparator have to be compared clause by clause. The applicant can pick
any part of the contract that provides more favourable terms to the comparator.
<p>Proving that the work is not equal
<p>The onus is on the employer to prove that the complainant is not carrying out like work, work
rated as equivalent or work of equal value when compared with the comparator. If the employer </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Equal Pay 277
<p>invokes job evaluation to provide support to a claim that the jobs are not equal, the scheme
must be analytical, unbiased and applied in a non-discriminatory way.
<p>&lsquo;Analytical&rsquo; means that the scheme must analyse and compare jobs by reference to factors such
as, in the words of the Equal Pay Regulations, &lsquo;effort, skill, decision&rsquo;. Slotting jobs on a whole-
job comparison basis is not acceptable as a defence. The legislation and case law do not specify
that a point-factor or a scored factor comparison scheme should be used, but even if an &lsquo;ana-
lytical matching&rsquo; process is followed (see Chapter 16) a tribunal may need to be convinced that
this is analytical within the meaning of the Act and has not led to biased decisions.
<p>Genuine material factor
<p>The legislation provides for a case to be made by the employer that there is a &lsquo;genuine material
factor&rsquo; creating and justifying the difference between the pay of the applicant and the compa-
rator. A genuine material factor could be the level of performance or length of service of the
comparator, which means that s/he is paid at a higher level than the applicant in the pay range
for a job. But this only applies if the basis for deciding on additions to pay and the process of
doing so is not discriminatory. The Crossley case referred to above is an example of where a
tribunal found that length of service criteria could be discriminatory if they meant that women
are paid less than men and find it hard to catch up.
<p>Pay differences because of market supplements can be treated as genuine material factors as
long as they are &lsquo;objectively justified&rsquo;. In the case of a claim that market pressures justify
unequal pay, the tribunal will need to be convinced that this was not simply a matter of opinion
and that adequate evidence from a number of sources was available when the decision was
made. In such cases, the tribunal will also require proof that the recruitment and retention of
the people required by the organization was difficult because pay levels were uncompetitive.
<p>However, The Employment Appeals Tribunal in the case of Sharp v. Caledonia Group Services
(2006) ruled that employers using the genuine material factor defence must &lsquo;objectively justify&rsquo;
it in all cases. This means showing that the pay disparity:
<p>is unrelated to sex; &bull;
<p>relates to a real need of the employer; &bull;
<p>is appropriate to achieving the objective pursued; &bull;
<p>is necessary to that end and is proportionate. &bull;
<p>In other words, the difference must be sensible and necessary rather than merely due to a
material factor.</p>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>278 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Independent experts
<p>If there is any doubt as to whether or not work is of equal value, employment tribunals will
require an independent expert to prepare a report. The expert must:
<p>evaluate the jobs concerned analytically; &bull;
<p>take account of all information supplied and representations that have a bearing on the &bull;
question;
<p>before reporting, send the parties a written summary of the information and invite rep- &bull;
resentations;
<p>include the representations in the report, together with the conclusion reached on the &bull;
case and the reason for that conclusion;
<p>take no account of the difference in sex, and at all times act fairly. &bull;
<p>The independent expert&rsquo;s task differs in a number of ways from that of someone carrying out
a conventional job evaluation within an organization. This is because the aim in the latter case
is to establish relative value by ranking a number of jobs, while an independent expert will be
concerned with comparative value &ndash; comparing the value of a fairly narrow range of jobs.
<p>Equal pay: six tips
Conduct an equal pay review. &bull;
<p>Develop and apply a non-discriminatory analytical job evaluation scheme. &bull;
<p>Ensure that the grade and pay structure is non-discriminatory. &bull;
<p>Ensure that pay system policies and practices in the form of grading jobs, &bull;
procedures for fixing rates of pay and pay progression systems are non-
discriminatory.
<p>Conduct an assessment of the risk of a successful equal pay claim. &bull;
<p>Ensure that line managers are aware of their responsibility to avoid pay &bull;
discrimination.

<p>Market Rate Analysis 281
<p>Introduction
<p>Market rate analysis is conducted through surveys that produce data on the levels of pay and
benefits for similar jobs in comparable organizations. It is the basis either for extreme market
pricing, as defined in Chapter 16, or for maintaining competitive rates of pay and benefits by
deciding on rates of pay for specific jobs or pay ranges in a grade and pay structure.
<p>Aims of market analysis
Obtain relevant, accurate and representative data on market rates. &bull;
<p>Compare like with like, in terms of data, regional and organizational variations &bull;
and, importantly, type and size of job or role.
<p>Obtain information that is as up to date as possible. &bull;
<p>Interpret data in a way that clearly indicates the action required. &bull;
<p>Decisions on levels of pay following market rate analysis will be guided by the pay policy of the
organization or its &lsquo;market stance&rsquo; &ndash; that is, how it wants its pay levels to relate to market
levels.
<p>Effective market rate analysis depends on understanding the concept of a market rate and the
factors affecting the validity and reliability of market rate data, as considered in the first two
parts of this chapter. The rest of the chapter deals with selecting the benchmark jobs used for
comparison, the sources of market rate data and how it should be used.
<p>The concept of a market rate
<p>People often refer to the &lsquo;market rate&rsquo;, but this is a much more elusive concept than it seems.
There is no such thing as a definitive market rate for any job, even when comparing identically
sized organizations in the same industry and location. There are local markets and there are
national markets, and none of them is perfect in the economists&rsquo; sense. Different market infor-
mation sources for the same types of jobs produce different results because of variations in the
sample, the difficulty of obtaining precise matches between jobs in the organization and jobs
elsewhere (job matching), and timing (the dates on which the data is collected may differ).
<p>This means that market rate analysis is most unlikely to produce information on the rate for
the job. The possibly incomplete data from a number of sources, some more reliable than
others, have to be interpreted to indicate what the organization should do about them. The
result of a market rate survey is often what is called a &lsquo;derived rate&rsquo;, which is a judgement on
what appears to be a reasonable rate made on the basis of an analysis of the data obtained from
a number of sources.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>282 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Factors determining the validity and reliability of market rate data
Job matching: the extent to which the external jobs with which the internal jobs &bull;
are being compared are similar; in other words, like is being compared with
like.
<p>Sample frame: the degree to which the sample of organizations from which the &bull;
data have been collected is fully representative of the organizations with which
comparisons need to be made in such terms as sector, technology or type of
business, size and location.
<p>Timing: the extent to which the information is up to date or can be updated &bull;
reliably. By their very nature, published surveys, upon which many people rely,
can soon become out of date. This can happen even at the moment they are
published &ndash; pay levels may have changed and people may have moved in or out
since the date of the original survey. Whilst it is not possible to overcome this
completely, as data must be gathered and analysed, surveys that aim to have as
short a time as possible between data collection and the publication of results
are likely to be of more use than those with longer lead times. Estimates can be
made of likely movements since the survey took place, but they are mainly
guesswork.
<p>Job matching
<p>Inadequate job matching is a major cause of inaccuracies in the data collected by market anal-
ysis. So far as possible, the aim is to match the jobs within the organization and those outside
(the comparators) so that like is being compared with like. It is essential to avoid crude and
misleading comparisons based on job titles alone or vague descriptions of job content. It is
first necessary to ensure that a broad match is achieved between the organization concerned
and the types of organizations used as comparators in terms of sector, industry classification,
size and location.
<p>The next step is to match jobs within the organizations concerned. The various methods in
ascending order of accuracy are:
<p>1. Job title: this can be misleading. Job titles by themselves give no indication of the range of
duties or the level of responsibility, and are sometimes used to convey additional status to
employees or their customers regardless of the real level of work done.
<p>2. Brief description of duties and level or zone of responsibility: national surveys frequently
restrict their job-matching definitions to a two or three-line description of duties and an
indication of levels of responsibility in rank order. The latter is often limited to a one-line </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Rate Analysis 283
<p>definition for each level or zone in a hierarchy. This approach provides some guidance on
job matching, which reduces major discrepancies, but it still leaves considerable scope for
discretion and can therefore provide only generalized comparisons.
<p>3. Capsule job descriptions: club or specialist &lsquo;bespoke&rsquo; surveys frequently use capsule job
descriptions that define main responsibilities and duties in about 100 to 200 words. To
increase the refinement of comparisons, modifying statements may be made indicating
where responsibilities are higher or lower than the norm. Capsule job descriptions con-
siderably increase the accuracy of comparisons as long as they are based on a careful anal-
ysis of actual jobs and include modifying statements. But they are not always capable of
dealing with specialist jobs and the accuracy of comparisons in relation to levels of respon-
sibility may be limited, even when modifiers are used.
<p>4. Full role profiles, including a factor analysis of the levels of responsibility involved, may be
used in special surveys when direct comparisons are made between jobs in different organ-
izations. They can be more accurate on a one-for-one basis but their use is limited because
of the time and labour involved in preparing them. A further limitation is that compara-
tor organizations may not have available, or not be prepared to make available, their own
full role profiles for comparison.
<p>5. Job evaluation: can be used in support of a capsule job description or a role profile to
provide a more accurate measure of relative job size. A common method of evaluation is
necessary. An increasing number of international and UK consultancies now claim to be
able to make this link, either through a point-factor scheme or a matching approach.
However, they do not necessarily restrict survey participation only to those organizations
that are prepared to conduct a full evaluation process. This approach will further increase
the accuracy of comparisons but the degree of accuracy will depend on the quality of the
job evaluation process.
<p>Use of benchmark jobs
<p>A market rate survey should aim to collect data on a representative sample of benchmark jobs,
which will be used to provide guidance on the design of a pay structure or as a basis for market
pricing. The jobs selected should be ones for which it is likely that market data will be availa-
ble. There are usually some jobs that are unique to the organization and for which compari-
sons cannot be made. When conducting a market pricing exercise, it is necessary to make a
judgement on the positioning of these jobs in the structure on the basis of comparisons with
the benchmark jobs. A point-factor evaluation scheme, if available, helps to make these com-
parisons more accurate.</p>

<p>284 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Sources of market data
<p>There is a wide variety of sources of varying quality. They include published surveys, special
surveys conducted by organizations, &lsquo;pay clubs&rsquo; (groups of organizations that exchange infor-
mation on pay and benefits) and advertisements. It is not advisable to rely on only one possi-
bly unreliable source.
<p>Should improvements in the quality of job matching be desirable, an individual survey can be
conducted or a salary club can be joined if there is room. If several sources are used, an objec-
tive justification can be produced for any market supplement or premium (an addition to the
normal rate for the job to reflect the market value of a job) that might create unequal pay.
<p>In choosing data sources it is important to take account of how easily replicable the analysis
will be in future years. Trends can only be identified if a consistent set of sources is used, and
if those sources are reasonably stable.
<p>Published surveys
<p>Published surveys are readily accessible and are usually based on a large sample. If the infor-
mation can be obtained online, so much the better. But the sources have to be relevant to the
needs of the organization and particular attention should always be paid to the range of data
and the quality of job matching. Published surveys are of widely varying content, presentation
and quality and are sometimes expensive. They can be national, local, sector, industrial or
occupational.
<p>When selecting a published survey the following questions should be considered:
<p>Does it cover relevant jobs in similar organizations? &bull;
<p>Does it provide the required information on the relevant pay and benefits? &bull;
<p>Are there enough participants to provide acceptable comparisons? &bull;
<p>So far as can be judged, is the survey conducted properly in terms of its sampling tech- &bull;
niques and the quality of job matching?
<p>Is it reasonably up to date? &bull;
<p>Are the results well presented? &bull;
<p>Does it provide value for money? &bull;
<p>As a starting point to identifying a relevant survey, look at the regular reviews included in pub-
lications from Incomes Data Services (IDS) and the Industrial Relations Services (IRS). Pay
analysts IDS also publishes a directory that brings together information on virtually every
available survey of salaries and benefits produced in the UK, providing an unmatched guide to
data sources. It currently lists some 290 surveys of salaries and benefits from 76 UK survey </p>

<p>producers, covering national surveys, local surveys, benefit surveys and international surveys,
and gives details of employee groups and jobs covered by each survey, sample size, date of the
survey data and the length and price of the report. Subscribers to the directory can also access
it online and search for data by job title, type of benefit, sector, UK region or overseas region.

<p>Consultants&rsquo; databases
<p>Many consultancies concerned with reward management have databases of market rates pro-
duced by their own surveys and contacts and often linked to their proprietary job evaluation
scheme.
<p>Special surveys
<p>Special surveys can be &lsquo;do it yourself&rsquo; affairs or they can be conducted for companies by
management consultants. The latter method costs more but it saves a lot of time and trouble,
and some organizations may be more willing to respond to an enquiry from a reputable
consultant.
<p>Conducting a special survey
<p>1. Decide what information is wanted.
<p>2. Identify the &lsquo;benchmark&rsquo; jobs for which comparative pay data is required. This
could have been done as part of a job evaluation exercise as described in Chapter
16.
<p>3. Produce capsule job descriptions for those jobs.
<p>4. Identify the organizations that are likely to have similar jobs.
<p>5. Contact those organizations and invite them to participate. It is usual to say that the
survey findings will be distributed to participants (this is the quid pro quo) and that
individual organizations will not be identified.
<p>6. Provide participants with a form to complete, together with notes for guidance and
capsule job descriptions. This includes provision for participants to indicate by a +
or &ndash; whether the size or scope of the job is larger or smaller than the capsule job
description indicates. Give them a reasonable amount of time to complete and
return the form, say two to three weeks.
<p>7. Analyse the returned forms and distribute a summary of the results to participants.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>286 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Special surveys can justify the time and trouble, or expense, by producing usefully comparable
data. It may, however, be difficult to get a suitable number of participants to take part, either
because organizations cannot be bothered or because they are already members of a survey
club or take part in a published survey.
<p>Club surveys
<p>Club surveys (pay clubs) are conducted by a number of organizations that agree to exchange
information on pay in accordance with a standard format and on a regular basis. They have all
the advantages of special surveys plus the additional benefits of saving a considerable amount
of time and providing regular information. It is well worth joining one if you can. If a suitable
club does not exist you could always try to start one, but this takes considerable effort.
<p>Advertisements
<p>Many organizations rely on the salary levels published in recruitment advertisements. But
these can be very misleading as you will not necessarily achieve a good match and the quoted
salary may not be the same as what is finally paid. However, although it is highly suspect, data
from advertisements can be used to supplement other more reliable sources.
<p>Other market intelligence
<p>Other market intelligence can be obtained from the publications of IDS and the IRS. This may
include useful information on trends in the &lsquo;going rate&rsquo; for general, across-the-board pay
increases that can be used when deciding on what sort of uplift, if any, is required to pay
scales.
<p>The features of the main sources and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in Table
18.1.
<p>Interpreting and presenting market rate data
<p>Market rate data need to be interpreted by reference to the details provided from each source
and by assessments of their reliability, accuracy and relevance.
<p>Data can be presented as measures of central tendency or measures of dispersion. Measures of
central tendency consist of the arithmetic mean (average) and the median &ndash; the middle item
in a distribution of individual items. The latter is the most commonly used measure because it
avoids the distortions to which arithmetic averages are prone.</p>

<p>Market Rate Analysis 289
<p>Measures of dispersion consist of:
<p>The upper quartile: the value above which 25 per cent of the individual values fall (this &bull;
term is often used more loosely to indicate any value within the top 25 per cent.
<p>The lower quartile: the value below which 25 per cent of the individual values fall. &bull;
<p>The inter-quartile range: the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. &bull;
<p>Using survey data
<p>The use of market survey data as a guide on pay levels is a process based on judgement and
compromise. Different sources may produce different indications of market rate levels. As a
result it is often necessary to produce a &lsquo;derived&rsquo; market rate based on an assessment of the
relative reliability of the data. This would strike a reasonable balance between the competing
merits of the different sources used. It is an intuitive process.
<p>Once all the data available have been collected and presented in the most accessible manner
possible (ie job by job for all the areas the structure is to cover), reference points can be deter-
mined for each pay range in a graded pay structure, as described in Chapter 19. This process
will take account of the place in the market the business wishes to occupy: that is, its market
&lsquo;stance&rsquo; or &lsquo;posture&rsquo;.
<p>Market rate analysis: six tips
Select benchmark jobs for which external market data is available. &bull;
<p>Identify all the sources of market rate information available, including pay &bull;
clubs, published data, consultancies and agencies and other sources of market
rate intelligence.
<p>Evaluate the sources to assess the likelihood of their producing valid and &bull;
reliable information.
<p>Use more than one source to collect as much comparative data as possible. &bull;
<p>Make every attempt to match internal benchmark jobs with jobs covered in the &bull;
data sources in order to compare like with like.
<p>Analyse the data from each source and if variable results are obtained (which is &bull;
likely) use judgement to produce a &lsquo;derived market rate&rsquo; using the most reliable
results.</p>

<p>Grade and Pay Structures 291
<p>Learning outcomes
<p>On completing this chapter you should be able to define these key concepts. You should
also know about:
<p>The nature of grade and pay structures &bull;
<p>Guiding principles for grade and pay &bull;
structures
<p>Types of grade and pay structures &bull;
<p>Choice of grade and pay structure &bull;
<p>Developing a grade and pay structure &bull;
<p>Introduction
<p>Grade and pay structures provide a framework within which an organization&rsquo;s base pay man-
agement policies are implemented. Base pay management can involve the design and opera-
tion of formal grade and pay structures that define where jobs should be placed in a hierarchy,
what people should be paid for them and the scope for pay progression. Base pay management
enables pay practices to be monitored and controlled, facilitates the management of relativi-
ties, and helps to communicate the pay and sometimes the career opportunities available to
employees. Alternatively, it may be concerned with the administration of unstructured
arrangements consisting of spot rates or individual job grades.
<p>This chapter is mainly concerned with formal grade and pay structures; reference will be made
to the other less formal pay arrangements of spot rates and individual job grades, which, while
not strictly structures, are frequently used by organizations to indicate how much a job or a
person should be paid.
<p>The chapter starts with definitions of grade and pay structures and the other pay arrange-
ments. This is followed by a list of guiding principles for grade and pay structures and descrip-
tions of each type of structure or arrangement, namely: narrow-graded, broad-graded and
broad-banded structures, career and job families, pay spines, spot rates and individual job
grades.
<p>Grade structures
<p>A grade structure consists of a sequence or hierarchy of grades, bands or levels into which
groups of jobs that are broadly comparable in size are placed. There may be a single structure
that is defined by the number of grades or bands it contains; alternatively the structure may be </p>

<br>
<p>292 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>divided into a number of career or job families consisting of groups of jobs where the essential
nature and purpose of the work are similar but the work is carried out at different levels.
<p>The main types of graded structures described in this chapter are:
<p>Narrow-graded structures, which consist of a sequence of narrow grades (generally 10 &bull;
or more). They are sometimes called multi-graded structures.
<p>Broad-graded structures, which have fewer grades (generally six to nine). &bull;
<p>Broad-banded structures, which consist of a limited number of grades or bands (often &bull;
four or five). Structures with six or seven grades are sometimes described as broad-
banded even when their characteristics are typical of broad grades.
<p>Career-family structures, which consist of a number of families (groups of jobs with &bull;
similar characteristics) each divided typically into six to eight levels. The levels are
described in terms of key responsibilities and knowledge, skill and competence require-
ments, and therefore define career progression routes within and between career fami-
lies. There is a common grade and pay structure across all the career families.
<p>Job-family structures, which are similar to career families except that pay levels in each &bull;
family may differ to reflect market rate considerations (this is sometimes referred to as
market grouping). The structure is therefore more concerned with market rate rela-
tivities than mapping careers. The number of levels in families may also vary.
<p>Combined structures, in which broad bands are superimposed on career/job families &bull;
or broad bands are divided into families.
<p>Pay spines, consisting of a series of incremental &lsquo;pay points&rsquo; extending from the lowest &bull;
to the highest-paid jobs covered by the structure.
<p>Pay structures
<p>A grade structure becomes a pay structure when pay ranges, brackets or scales are attached to
each grade, band or level. In some broad-banded structures, as described later in this chapter,
reference points and pay zones may be placed within the bands and these define the range of
pay for jobs allocated to each band.
<p>Pay structures are defined by the number of grades they contain and, especially in narrow or
broad-graded structures, the span or width of the pay ranges attached to each grade. They
define the different levels of pay for jobs or groups of jobs by reference to their relative internal
value as determined by job evaluation, to external relativities as established by market rate
surveys, and sometimes to negotiated rates for jobs. They provide scope for pay progression in
accordance with performance, competence, contribution or service.</p>

<p>Grade and Pay Structures 293
<p>There may be a single pay structure covering the whole organization or there may be one
structure for staff and another for manual workers, but this is becoming less common. There
has in recent years been a trend towards &lsquo;harmonizing&rsquo; terms and conditions between differ-
ent groups of staff as part of a move towards single status. This has been particularly evident
in many public sector organizations in the UK, supported by national agreements on &lsquo;single
status&rsquo;. Executive directors are sometimes treated separately.
<p>The CIPD 2009 reward survey found that 35 per cent of respondents had individual pay rates/
ranges/spot salaries, 24 per cent had broad-banded structures (this includes broad-graded
structures), 19 per cent had pay spines, 15 per cent had job or career-family structures and 19
per cent had narrow-graded structures.
<p>Guiding principles for grade and pay structures
<p>Grade and pay structures should:
<p>be appropriate to the culture, characteristics and needs of the organization and its &bull;
employees;
<p>facilitate the management of relativities and the achievement of equity, fairness, con- &bull;
sistency and transparency in managing gradings and pay;
<p>enable jobs to be graded appropriately and not be subject to grade drift; &bull;
<p>be flexible enough to adapt to pressures arising from market rate changes and skill &bull;
shortages;
<p>facilitate operational flexibility and continuous development; &bull;
<p>provide scope as required for rewarding performance, contribution and increases in &bull;
skill and competence;
<p>clarify reward, lateral development and career opportunities; &bull;
<p>be constructed logically and clearly so that the basis upon which they operate can &bull;
readily be communicated to employees;
<p>enable the organization to exercise control over the implementation of pay policies and &bull;
budgets.
<p>Narrow-graded structures
<p>Until fairly recently the typical type of structure was the narrow, multi-graded pay structure
illustrated in Figure 19.1.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>294 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>What
<p>&pound;
<p>Figure 19.1 A narrow-graded structure
<p>However, this type of structure is being replaced in many organizations by structures that have
fewer grades (broad-grade structures) or with broad-banded, career-family or job-family
structures.
<p>Grades in a narrow-graded structure
<p>A narrow-graded structure consists of a sequence of job grades into which jobs of broadly
equivalent value are placed. There may be 10 or more grades, and long-established structures,
especially in the public sector, may have as many as 18. Grades may be defined by a bracket of
job evaluation points so that any job for which the job evaluation score falls with the points
bracket for a grade would be allocated to that grade. Alternatively, grades may be defined by
grade definitions or profiles that, if analytical factor comparison is used as described in Chapter
16, provide the information required to match jobs set out under job demand factor headings.
This information can be supplemented by reference to benchmark jobs that have been already
graded as part of the structure design exercise.
<p>Pay ranges
<p>A pay range is attached to each grade. This allows scope for pay progression related to per-
formance, contribution or competence. In a narrow-graded pay spine, progression is through
fixed increments based on length of service in the job. The four characteristics of pay ranges as
described below are span, reference points or target rates, differentials and overlap.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 295
<p>Span
<p>Pay ranges may be described in terms of their span (the percentage by which the highest point
exceeds the lowest point). This is usually between 20 per cent and 50 per cent (30 to 40 per
cent is typical). A span of 40 per cent would be &pound;20,000 to &pound;28,000. The centre of the range is
called the mid-point.
<p>Alternatively, ranges are described as a percentage of the mid-point, for example, 80 per cent
to 120 per cent. In this case, the mid-point of 100 per cent could be &pound;25,000 and the minimum
and maximum would be &pound;20,000 (80 per cent) and &pound;30,000 (120 per cent) respectively. This
span is on the high side at 50 per cent.
<p>Mid-point management techniques, as described in Chapter 28, can help to control the struc-
ture. They use compa-ratios that express the actual rate of pay as a percentage of the mid-point
when the latter is regarded as the policy rate of pay or the reference point.
<p>Reference point
<p>A reference point or target rate is often defined in each grade, which is the rate for a fully com-
petent individual who is completely qualified to carry out the job. This is sometimes called the
policy rate because it is usually aligned to market rates in accordance with company policies
on the relationship between its pay levels and market rates for similar jobs (its &lsquo;market stance&rsquo;).
The reference point is commonly the mid-point of the pay range for a grade. It may be called
a target rate when it is regarded as the consolidated rate to which individuals should aspire
when they are fully competent and experienced in their roles. In some schemes people who
reach this rate are then only entitled to non-consolidated cash bonuses for exceptional achieve-
ment, although this may be consolidated (ie incorporated in the base rate) if the level of
achievement is sustained over two or three years.
<p>Differentials
<p>Differentials between pay ranges &ndash; the percentage by which the mid-point of a range is higher
than the mid-point of the range below &ndash; are typically between 15 per cent and 20 per cent but
they can be as high as 25 per cent. Too low a differential means that the scope for pay progres-
sion on upgrading is limited. Too high a differential means that a decision to upgrade may
mean that the increase in pay is disproportionate to the increase in responsibility.
<p>Overlap
<p>There is usually an overlap between ranges. Thus if a pay range for a grade is &pound;20,000 to
&pound;24,000 and the range for the grade above is &pound;22,000 to &pound;26,000, the overlap is &pound;2,000 (&pound;24,000
minus &pound;22,000. This is illustrated in Figure 19.2.</p>

<p>Overlap
{
<p>Figure 19.2 Example of overlap
<p>This can be expressed as the difference between the highest point of the range below and the
lowest point of the range above as a percentage of the difference between the lowest and highest
point in the range below by means of the following formula:
<p>24,000 &ndash; 22,000
24,000 &ndash; 20,000
<p>&times; 100 = 50%
<p>In this example the differential between the mid-points of the adjacent grades is fairly low at 9
per cent. Increasing the differential to about 15 per cent and adjusting the higher range to
&pound;23,000&ndash;&pound;28,000 would decrease the overlap to 25 per cent. The degree of overlap can be
manipulated at the design stage by varying differentials and ranges. An overlap provides more
flexibility. It enables recognition to be given to the fact that a highly experienced individual at
the top of a range may be contributing more than someone who is still in the learning curve
portion of the next higher grade.
<p>Advantages and disadvantages of narrow-graded structures
<p>Narrow-graded structures provide a framework for managing relativities and for ensuring that
jobs of equal value are paid equally. In theory they are easy to manage because the large number
of grades enables fine distinctions to be made between different levels of responsibility. They
define career ladders, and staff may favour them because they appear to offer plenty of oppor-
tunities for increasing pay by upgrading.
<p>The main problem with narrow, multi-graded structures is that if there are too many grades,
there will be constant pressure for upgrading, leading to grade drift (unjustified upgradings).
They can be aligned to a traditional extended hierarchy that may no longer exist, and can func-
tion rigidly, which is at odds with the requirement of flexibility in new team and process-based
organizations. They also reinforce the importance of promotion as a means of progression,
which may run counter to the need for organizations to be more flexible and grow capability
by moving people within grades to broaden their experience and competencies.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 297
<p>Example: Lands&rsquo; End
<p>Salaried staff at Lands&rsquo; End are on a 10-grade pay structure, with the bottom two grades over-
lapping with hourly rates of pay and the top grade covering directors. Each grade has a range,
divided into thirds:
<p>Bottom third of the range: for those who have moved into the job, and are developing &bull;
their skills; staff generally stay in it for about 18 months.
<p>Middle third of the grade: for effective and experienced staff; many will stay in this &bull;
third.
<p>Top third: for the best performers, those who are pushing at the limits of the job and &bull;
who are regularly appraised as highly effective.
<p>Broad-graded structures
<p>Broad-graded structures generally have six to nine grades rather than the 10 or more grades
contained in narrow-graded structures. More and more organizations are adopting them
because they represent the realities of hierarchies in today&rsquo;s &lsquo;flatter&rsquo; structures, are easier to
manage, can be used more flexibly and can reduce grade drift.
<p>The grades and pay ranges are defined and managed in the same way as narrow-graded struc-
tures except that wider pay spans mean that organizations sometimes introduce mechanisms
to control progression in the grade so that staff do not inevitably reach its upper pay limit. The
mechanisms available consist of:
<p>Reference point control: scope is provided for progression according to competence by &bull;
increments to the reference point. Thereafter, individuals may earn cash bonuses for
high achievement, which may be consolidated up to the maximum pay for the grade if
high achievement levels are sustained.
<p>Threshold control: a point is defined in the pay range beyond which pay cannot increase &bull;
unless individuals achieve a defined level of competence and achievement.
<p>Segment or zone control: an extension of threshold control that involves dividing the &bull;
grade into, usually, three segments or zones.
<p>All these mechanisms require the use of some form of contingent pay, as described in
Chapter 10.
<p>Broad-graded structures are used to overcome or at least alleviate the grade drift problem
endemic in narrow-graded structures. If the grades are defined, it is easier to differentiate
them, and matching (comparing role profiles with grade definitions or profiles to find the best
fit) becomes more accurate. But it may be difficult to control progression and this would </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>298 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>increase the costs of operating such systems, although these costs could be offset by better
control of grade drift.
<p>Example of broad-grading at Bristol-Myers Squibb
<p>Pay is determined in relation to the market, and is pitched at the median, though the total
reward package is upper quartile. There are eight overlapping bands, each with a span of
between 80 per cent and 100 per cent, covering everyone apart from the UK&rsquo;s dozen or so
senior executives. The bands are:
<p>D 1 Basic clerical, factory semi-skilled.
<p>D 2 Clerical and factory semi-skilled.
<p>D 3 Clerical and factory supervisor.
<p>D 4 Senior supervisor, entry level for professionals (eg scientists), customer-facing sales staff.
<p>D 5 Customer-facing sales staff.
<p>D 6 First level manager, head of department.
<p>D 7 Function heads.
<p>D 8 Business heads, eg oncology, finance.
<p>These eight bands are used in all the countries in which Bristol-Myers Squibb operates, though
the salaries attached to them are locally determined. But the bands are seen as more of a safety
net than anything else and something that the US parent is keen to retain, although the market
is more important in the UK. The company says the bands are helpful if there is an intention
to recruit someone at a salary way over or under the band, which signals that the job may need
to be re-graded.
<p>Example of broad-grading at Camelot
<p>The broad-graded structure at Camelot is market driven &ndash; its focus is on paying the market
rate for each job. Every salary is benchmarked against the market to ensure that jobholders are
being &lsquo;paid fairly for the job that they do&rsquo;, with base pay set at the median market rate. The fol-
lowing six-level banding structure, covering everyone except the chief executive, is used:
<p>Bands A and B cover administrative support and IT roles. &bull;
<p>Band C includes supervisors, professionals and specialists. &bull;
<p>Band D is for middle management. &bull;
<p>Band E is for heads of department. &bull;
<p>Band F covers functional directors. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 299
<p>Bands have some overlap, and each job has its own pay range within a band. The range is 85
per cent to 115 per cent, with 100 per cent being the rate for the job. The ranges are bench-
marked against the market twice a year.
<p>Example of broad-grading at COLT Telecom
<p>There are nine job levels or grades at COLT Telecom. They were introduced as a way of:
<p>providing transparency in the organizational structure; &bull;
<p>providing an equitable reward framework for base pay, variable pay and long-term &bull;
incentives;
<p>ensuring consistency and fairness across functions and countries; &bull;
<p>allowing cross-function and country comparison; &bull;
<p>beginning to clarify career development and progression; &bull;
<p>supporting the &lsquo;One COLT&rsquo; culture and values of open and honest communication; &bull;
<p>aiding internal and external benchmarking of remuneration. &bull;
<p>COLT levels seek to aid succession planning and promotion. An advantage of having a formal
job level structure is that managers will be able to communicate how and when their team
members can progress. As the levels are fairly broad, not all promotions or role changes will
result in a level change. However, if a role changes or a move is made within the organization
to a different department, the job level can be reviewed and adjusted as appropriate.
<p>Example of broad-grading at Friends Provident
<p>At Friends Provident there are eight bands, five for non-management staff, to replace the nine
previous grades, and three additional bands to cover everyone below executive director level.
Generic skills and competency levels have been established to describe the broad requirements
for each band. Each of the career bands is broad, and although there is a mid-point the
company tells staff that they should not believe that the rate for the job is the mid-point or
control point. Staff who are developing their role should be in the lower quartile of the range,
staff who are fully performing are at the median, while those who are regularly exceeding all
requirements should be being paid at the upper quartile. A normal distribution would be 25
per cent developing, 50 per cent fully performing and 25 per cent exceeding requirements.
<p>Example of broad-grading at Lloyds TSB
<p>Every role in Lloyds TSB has a market reference point that indicates the normal rate of pay for
a fully effective performer. There is a published salary range for each grade (in other words, a </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>300 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>minimum and maximum salary) based on pay rates within the market. Each grade has three
zones:
<p>Primary zone: for people new to the role and still developing in that role. Typically &ndash; &bull;
but not in every case &ndash; Lloyds TSB expects an employee to be performing to a &lsquo;fully
effective&rsquo; level after two or three years in the role and to move to the next zone. If an
employee&rsquo;s salary is currently below the bottom zone and his or her work is judged sat-
isfactory, pay will automatically be adjusted upwards.
<p>Market zone: if an employee is fully effective in a role, his or her pay should be managed &bull;
towards or in the &lsquo;market&rsquo; zone (if an employee moves to a new role, pay will start in
the market zone as long as he or she has the necessary knowledge, competencies and
skills to be fully effective from the outset). Broadly speaking, the market zone reflects
the rate that other employers would pay for a particular job. These rates are set with
data provided by independent pay consultants.
<p>High-performance zone: if an employee consistently makes a superior contribution to &bull;
the business, his or her pay is managed towards or in the high-performance zone.
<p>Work levels at Unilever
<p>Unilever rejected the notion of broad-banding and introduced its &lsquo;work level&rsquo; structure in the
mid-1990s. This is a variation of broad-grading using different nomenclature and a special
approach to defining levels. There are six work levels, each subdivided into a number of pay
grades. The levels were determined according to the idea of the time-span of discretion devel-
oped by Eliot Jaques (1961) and also measure the strategic importance of particular jobs. The
three principles underlying levels are:
<p>The major tasks of any job fall into a single work level. This is the case despite the fact &bull;
that a job may include a mixture of tasks, with an executive making strategic decisions
also undertaking less demanding administrative tasks.
<p>At each successive higher work level, decisions of a broader nature are taken in an &bull;
increasingly complex environment. Discretion and the authority required to do the job
also increase, and more time is required to assess the impact of these decisions. Assign-
ing jobs to work levels involves identifying the decisions that are unique to a job. This
helps to highlight differences in management decision making and accountability,
which in turn allows the management structure to be more clearly delineated.
<p>Each work level above the first requires one and only one layer of management. A layer &bull;
of management is necessary only where a manager makes decisions that could not be
taken by subordinates, who may be more than one level below their boss. The compa-
ny&rsquo;s work levels approach ensures that job holders take decisions that cannot be taken
at a lower level.</p>

<p>Grade and Pay Structures 301
<p>Broad-banded structures
<p>Broad-banded structures have up to six &lsquo;bands&rsquo; as distinct from the 10 or more grades in a
narrow-graded structure and the six to nine grades in a broad-graded structure, as illustrated
in Figure 19.3. The term broad-banded is often used to describe a structure with over six bands
or grades but it is useful to make the distinction between broad-graded structures, which are
managed in the same way as narrow-graded structures, and broad-banded structures, which
are managed quite differently as described below. The process of developing broad-banded
structures is called &lsquo;broad-banding&rsquo;.
<p>Genesis of the concept
<p>The notion of broad-banding crossed the Atlantic in the early 1990s, although it was referred
to, briefly, by Armstrong and Murlis in 1988. An article by Leblanc (1992) produced one of the
earliest definitions of broad-banding: &lsquo;Fewer pay grades for all types of jobs and more hori-
zontal (lateral) movement&rsquo;. Broad-banding really came to the fore in the mid-1990s when
Gilbert and Abosch (1996) wrote about how it had been developed in General Electric in
support of the Jack Welch philosophy of boundaryless (and de-layered) organizations. Since
then it has burgeoned.
<p>The difference between a broad-graded structure and a broad-banded structure is important.
It was originally made by Gilbert and Abosch in 1996. They referred to broad-grade structures
with seven or eight grades in which a fairly conventional approach to pay management is often
adopted using mid-point management, compa-ratio analysis and pay matrix techniques. They
contrasted these with what they called &lsquo;career band&rsquo; structures with four to five bands where
the emphasis is on individual career development, flexible roles and competence growth.

<br>
<p>302 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>The original concept of broad-banding
<p>In its original version, a broad-banded structure contained no more than five bands, each
with, typically, a span of 70 per cent to 100 per cent. Bands were unstructured and pay was
managed much more flexibly than in a conventional graded structure (no limits may be
defined for progression) and much more attention was paid to market rates, which governed
what were in effect the spot rates for jobs within bands. Progression in bands depended on
competency and the assumption of wider role responsibilities. Bands were described verbally,
not by reference to the results of analytical job evaluation. More authority was devolved to line
managers to make pay decisions within a looser framework.
<p>Research conducted by Armstrong and Ryden (1997) found that in the 10 organizations they
studied the median number of bands was five. There were no fixed limits to bands in three of
them and the others typically had limits of up to 100 per cent.
<p>Later research by Armstrong and Brown (2001) established that in organizations with broad
bands, 62 per cent had bands with widths between 50 per cent and 75 per cent, while the rest
had bands with widths between 75 per cent and 100 per cent. Typically, there were between
four and six bands in such structures. The band boundaries were often, but not always, defined
by job evaluation. Jobs were placed in the bands purely by reference to market rates or by a
combination of job evaluation and market rate analysis. Bands were described by an overall
description of the jobs allocated to them (senior management etc) or by reference to the
generic roles they contained, for instance technical support.
<p>This concept was, and still is, beguiling. Broad-banded structures are simpler and therefore
easier to design. They satisfy the desire for more flexibility, and Armstrong and Brown&rsquo;s (2001)
research established that this was by far the most important reason for introducing broad-
bands. Flexibility is achieved by catering for broader roles rather than tightly defined jobs, by
adopting less rigid approaches to the allocation of roles to bands and how people progress
within them, and by being able to respond more quickly to market rate pressures. In the
United States the advantages of doing without formal job evaluation and using market pricing
were originally the most powerful arguments in favour of broad-banding. This remains the
case there, but in the UK the use of job evaluation rather than market pricing is still common
and the original concept of broad-banded structures has never been taken up as enthusiasti-
cally as in the United States. An aspect of flexibility that is seldom discussed in public is that
when introducing broad-bands the wider span of pay means that fewer anomalies are created
and the cost of implementation is reduced.
<p>Moreover, broad-banding was in accord with the drive for de-layering. The reduction in the
number of grades meant that the pressure for upgrading was reduced, there was less likelihood
of grade drift and it was thought that grades would be easier to manage.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 303
<p>Further developments in the concept
<p>The original notion of unstructured broad bands is now no longer general practice in the UK.
It created expectations of the scope for progression that could not be met. Progression had to
stop somewhere if costs were going to be controlled, and no rationale was available for decid-
ing when and why to stop. Line managers felt adrift without adequate guidance and staff
missed the structure they were used to. Questions were asked about the point of having broad
bands at all when in effect all they consisted of was spot rates determined mainly by market
relativities. Why, people asked, should organizations not be honest with themselves and their
staff and revert to the complete freedom and therefore flexibility that spot rates provide?
<p>Inevitably, therefore, structure crept in. It started with reference points aligned to market rates
around which similar roles could be clustered. These were then extended into zones for individ-
ual jobs or groups of jobs, as illustrated in Figure 19.4 (based on a structure in a financial services
company). Reference points are frequently placed in zones so that they increasingly resemble
conventional structure grades. Armstrong and Brown (2001) established that 80 per cent of
organizations had introduced some controls in the form of zones (43 per cent) and zones with
reference points (37 per cent). Job evaluation was used not only to define the boundaries of the
band but to size jobs as a basis for deciding where reference points should be placed in conjunc-
tion with market pricing. Progressively, therefore, the original concept of broad-banding was
eroded as more structure was introduced and job evaluation became more prominent to define
the structure and meet equal pay requirements. Zones within broad bands began to look very
like conventional grades. An example of a broad-banded structure linked to job evaluation is
given in Figure 19.5 (based on a structure developed for Notting Hill Housing Association).

<p>Band definitions
<p>There are five ways of defining bands, as set out below. The first four are descriptive in increas-
ing degrees of complexity. They simplify the process of allocating roles to bands although
judgement is required. However, this may not matter too much if there is a considerable
amount of overlap in pay spans or opportunities between adjacent bands. The fifth method is
the use of job evaluation.
<p>1. Descriptive labels: these refer to the generic roles that have been allocated to bands &ndash; for
example, senior managers, managers, team leaders, individual contributors (technical
and professional) and individual contributors (administration and support).
<p>2. Outline generic descriptions of jobs in band: these briefly expand descriptive labels, eg:
<p>Senior managers: executives in charge of a major function or department. &ndash;
<p>Managers: of a sub-division of a major function or department, or a small &ndash;
department.
<p>Team leaders: in charge of a small team of individual contributors. &ndash;
<p>Individual contributors (technical and professional): junior technical or profes- &ndash;
sional specialists working as members of a team.
<p>Individual contributors (administration and support): members of teams carrying &ndash;
out basic administrative or support roles.

<p>4. Extended analytical description of bands: a full analysis of the generic characteristics of
jobs in the bands is illustrated in Figure 19.7.
<p>5. Use of job evaluation: bands can be defined in terms of a range of job evaluation points,
as illustrated in Figure 19.5. Jobs are traditionally graded in conventional pay structures
through analytical job evaluation &ndash; points brackets are attached to each grade and indi-
vidual roles are &lsquo;sized&rsquo; and allocated into grades by comparing scores with the points
brackets attached to them. The difference when developing a broad-banded structure is
that an a priori decision may have been made on the number of bands and how they
should be described and defined. In these circumstances, job evaluation is simply used to
determine points dimensions for the bands as a guide to where roles should be allocated.
<p>Allocation of jobs to bands
<p>When bands are defined descriptively, a job slotting or analytical matching approach can be
used to allocate jobs to them. Slotting is the process of placing a job in a band by reference to
grade definitions that have not been analysed into factors. It is essentially the non-analytical
job evaluation technique of job classification, but it is easier to make decisions if broad generic
definitions exist for a small number of bands than in a multi-graded structure. Analytical
matching means allocating benchmark roles to bands by comparing their characteristics as
expressed in a role profile with the previously prepared band definitions or profiles that have </p>

work exists. Analytical matching is a form of job evaluation, but it is much simpler and less
time-consuming than point-factor job evaluation because detailed measurement is not
required.
<p>Where bands are described in terms of job evaluation scores, the allocation can be made by
reference to an evaluation using a point-factor scheme. However, analytical matching is being
increasingly used for broad bands and, indeed, in conventional graded structures.
<p>Reservations about broad-banding
<p>The two reservations that emerged from the experience of developing broad bands in the
1990s and early 2000s were: 1) What&rsquo;s the point of unstructured broad bands if they simply
consist of spot rates? and 2) What&rsquo;s the difference between, say, a four-banded structure with
three zones in each band and a 12-graded structure? The answer given by broad band devotees
to the first question was that at least there was some overall structure within which spot rates
could be managed. In reply to the second question, the usual answer was that as roles develop,
movements between zones within bands could be dealt with more flexibly. Neither of these
responses is particularly convincing.
<p>Objections to broad-banding
<p>Apart from these fundamental reservations, there are a number of other objections to broad-
banding. In general, it has been found that broad-banded structures are harder to manage
than narrower graded structures in spite of the original claim that they would be easier &ndash; they
make considerable demands on line managers as well as HR. It was noted by Armstrong (2000)
that broad-banding was not an easy option. Pay can spin out of control unless steps are taken </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 307
<p>to prevent that happening. As a reward manager in an engineering company told him: &lsquo;Broad
bands offer huge scope for flexibility, but equally huge scope for getting it wrong.&rsquo;
<p>Broad-banding can build employee expectations of significant pay opportunities, which are
doomed in many cases if proper control of the system is maintained. It can be difficult to
explain to people how broad-banding works and how they will be affected, and they may be
concerned by the apparent lack of structure and precision. Decisions on movements within
bands can be harder to justify objectively than in other types of grade and pay structures.
<p>Broad-banded structures may be more costly than more conventional structures because there
is less control over pay progression. Research conducted by Fay et al (2004) in the United
States found that both base pay and total cash compensation was significantly higher in the
companies with broad-banded structures than in those with more conventional structures.
They estimated that broad-banding increased pay roll costs by 7 per cent plus.
<p>Another major objection to broad-banding is that it can create the following equal pay
problems:
<p>Reliance on external relativities (market rates) to place jobs in bands can reproduce &bull;
existing inequalities in the labour market.
<p>The broader pay ranges within bands mean that they include jobs of widely different &bull;
values or sizes, which may result in gender discrimination.
<p>Women may be assimilated at their present rates in the lower regions of bands and find &bull;
it impossible, or at least very difficult, to catch up with their male colleagues who,
because of their existing higher rates of pay, are assimilated in the upper reaches of
bands.
<p>Broad-banding in its original sense is therefore not the panacea it was once thought to be.
More organizations are settling for a broad-graded structure with six to nine grades, with the
possibility of restricting the number to five but recognizing that they have to contain control
mechanisms that might take the form of a series of zones.
<p>Examples
Britannia Building Society
<p>The Britannia Building Society has a six-band structure, although within these there are 38
separate role profiles. The pay ranges for the bands are based on external market comparisons.
Mapping individual staff to the role profiles involved a process of job evaluation and valida-
tion by management teams.</p>

<p>308 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>GlaxoSmithKline
<p>GlaxoSmithKline has five bands: A and B for are for top executives, band C is for directors and
managers, band D covers professional and technical staff and band E comprises administrative
staff. These bands determine benefit entitlements. Pay for manufacturing staff is negotiated
with the trade unions; these job grades are subject to local agreement and are not included in
the grading structure.
<p>Each band is divided into a number of zones for pay purposes. For example, band D is divided
into six zones, and band E has five zones. The combination of band and zone produces the
grade, and there are 29 grades in total. These grades are also important for determining bonus
entitlement. The pay for each grade ranges approximately 25 per cent either side of the range
mid-point.
<p>Tesco
<p>The broad-banded structure consists of six &lsquo;work levels&rsquo; that cover all staff from the shopfloor
to the main board, replacing the previous 22 grades:
<p>Work level 1 covers all clerical jobs. &bull;
<p>Work levels 2, 3 and 4 cover all staff other than those in clerical jobs and directors. The &bull;
maximum of each of the bands in these levels is at least 100 per cent above the
minimum.
<p>Work levels 5 and 6 are for main board and senior directors, whose pay is determined &bull;
on an individual basis.
<p>Career-family structures
<p>Career or job families consist of jobs in a function or occupation such as marketing, opera-
tions, finance, IT, HR, administration or support services that are related through the activ-
ities carried out and the basic knowledge and skills required, but in which the levels of
responsibility, knowledge, skill or competency needed differ. In a career-family structure as
illustrated in Figure 19.8, the different career families are identified and the successive levels
in each family are defined by reference to the key activities carried out and the knowledge
and skills or competencies required to perform them effectively. They therefore define career
paths &ndash; what people have to know and be able to do to advance their career within a family
and to develop career opportunities in other families. These career paths are the distin-
guishing characteristic of career-family structures, which are as much about defining career
progression routes as they are about defining a pay structure. Typically, career families have
between six and eight levels, as in broad-graded structures. Some families may have more
levels than others.</p>

<p>Figure 19.8 A career-family structure
<p>In effect, a career structure is a single graded structure in which each grade has been divided
into families. The difference between a conventional graded structure and a career-family
structure is that in the former the grade definitions are all the same. In a career-family struc-
ture, although the levels may be defined generally for all families, separate definitions expressed
as competency requirements exist for levels in each of the career families.
<p>Competency-defined grades or bands in a career-family structure
<p>Defining grades or bands in terms of competencies results in what Risher (2002) describes as
a &lsquo;career ladder&rsquo; structure. He reports the practice of three companies &ndash; Dow, IBM and Mar-
riott Hotels &ndash; which have defined a set of brief competency factors or criteria that provide a
simple and transparent framework based on levels in a career ladder. The criteria consist of the
competencies such as knowledge, skills and abilities required at each level.
<p>An example of a UK approach to career ladders is provided by the NHS as part of its &lsquo;Agenda
for Change&rsquo; project. Its skills ladder is illustrated in Figure 19.9.</p>

<p>Advantages and disadvantages
<p>Career-family structures provide the foundation for personal development planning by defin-
ing the knowledge, skills and competencies required at higher levels or in different functions,
and describing what needs to be learnt through experience, education or training. Level defi-
nitions in a family can be more accurate than in a conventional structure because they concen-
trate on roles within the family with common characteristics and do not attempt to cover a
wide and in some ways unconnected set of skills across the whole organization. Furthermore,
the existence of a common grading system when it is supported by job evaluation facilitates
the achievement of equal pay for work of equal value. Finally, linking pay and grade manage-
ment with career development is in accordance with good practice human resource manage-
ment in the shape of &lsquo;bundling&rsquo; &ndash; the belief, supported by extensive research, that HR practices
will be more effective if they are interrelated and therefore complement and reinforce one
another.
<p>But career structures can be more difficult to develop, explain and manage than single grade
structures. A considerable amount of work is required to produce clear analytical level defini-
tions that are properly graded and provide good career guidelines. A broad-graded structure,
for example, is a simple and straightforward concept, and splitting it into families may increase
the complexity without providing commensurate benefits. Maintaining the accuracy of the
level definitions also demands much care and attention. It is these problems that are perhaps
the main reason why career structures have not yet caught on.
<p>Furthermore, whatever emphasis is placed on career development between as well as within
families, they could be perceived as being divisive and in conflict with the principle of identical
treatment for all enshrined in a single grade structure. It may be inferred that progression can </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 311
<p>only take place in an occupational &lsquo;silo&rsquo;. This has meant that career-family approaches have
been abandoned where the silos have been narrowly drawn and managed rigidly &ndash; the simpler
they are the better.
<p>Examples
Career families at Aegon UK
<p>The range of different roles within the business has been organized into four career families,
which are defined as groups of jobs where the technical knowledge and behavioural skills are
similar and recognizable by the external labour market. The families are operations delivery,
team leader and technical, junior management, professional and senior technical, and man-
agement and senior professional.
<p>The aim is to provide information on development opportunities and career paths that, as
part of a performance management process, can contribute to performance development and
training. Within each career family there are defined career paths for progressing to higher
levels by clarifying what skills individuals have to demonstrate if they wish to move to a new
career path. The career families can therefore provide the foundation for personal develop-
ment planning by defining the knowledge and skills required at higher levels or in different
functions and what needs to be learnt through experience, education or training. Employees
are able to understand not only how they can develop their skills and competence within their
current role, but also how they can move through their career path to specialist roles. Routes
are also shown into career paths in other parts of the organization.
<p>Career bands at Friends Provident
<p>The pay structure at Friends Provident has eight overlapping career bands below executive
director level. Bands A to E cover non-management staff, as shown in Table 19.1 and the
three additional bands are manager, head of department and director. Career bands reflect
each of the significant steps in an individual&rsquo;s career. Movement from one band to another
is earned when individuals demonstrate real potential for working to the higher level of
skills and knowledge and when there is a requirement for someone at this level within the
business unit.
<p>Each band is broadly defined in terms of the minimum expected level of competence required
for entry. This aims to encourage a focus on the requirements at either end of the band, and
therefore highlight the range of salary potential between the two.
<p>In bands A and B, staff are carrying out generalist administrative support functions, so the
differentials between job families tend to be insignificant. Salary ranges apply to all staff
across the company and are not related to job family (though the impact of location is
recognized).</p>

<p>In career bands C, D and E, however, staff will often be following a specific career path and will
be developing specialist skills and knowledge and possibly studying for additional qualifica-
tions. The market rates of pay reflect this with noticeable differences in the rates of pay for dif-
ferent job families.
<p>Career-family structure at Norwich Union Insurance
<p>There are 19 career families, defined as a cluster of jobs with similar skill requirements and
activities. Levels of responsibility vary within the family. The career framework helps staff to
understand how their jobs fit within their business unit and the organization as a whole and
supports movement across the organization, since individuals can identify jobs at a similar
level in other families that they might like to join. The skills, knowledge and behaviours profile
for each role is published to facilitate this. Each family contains between four and seven levels,
each with a pay range with an 80 per cent minimum, a market salary guide for competent per-
formance and no maximum. Career families also aim to facilitate the payment of market rates,
since jobs can be benchmarked more directly with comparable jobs elsewhere.
<p>Each of the career bands is broad, and although there is clearly a mid-point the company tells
staff that they should not believe that the rate for the job is the mid-point or control point.
Broadly speaking, staff who are developing their role should be in the lower quartile of the
range, staff who are fully performing are at the median while those who are regularly exceed-
ing all requirements should be being paid at the upper quartile. A normal distribution would
be 25 per cent developing, 50 per cent fully performing and 25 per cent exceeding require-
ments.

<p>Career families at NSPCC
<p>There are seven career families in the NSPCC covering the different job functions such as
Work with children, Fundraising, IT and Finance. The families were developed by evaluating
all jobs using a new and tailor-made system of analytical job matching. Detailed role profiles
were written and then jobs were slotted into the new structure of seven grades by matching
them with the most appropriate grade description.
<p>Career-family structure at XANSA
<p>The categorization of career families, jobs, jobs map and skills profiles for each job at XANSA
is known as the career framework. It is a tool that provides a common approach to people
development and performance management and is designed to help employees and line
managers to:
<p>identify career options; &bull;
<p>prepare for performance review and personal development discussions; &bull;
<p>assess suitability for job moves; &bull;
<p>identify training and development needs; &bull;
<p>assist in recruitment and selection interviews; &bull;
<p>position new employees into appropriate roles. &bull;
<p>The career families fall into four groups:
<p>Delivery: design, build/integrate, run and support, management, business services and &bull;
training.
<p>Consultancy. &bull;
<p>Business development: general management, sales and strategic development, and &bull;

<p>Professional support: business support, finance human resources and marketing/com- &bull;
munications.
<p>Job-family structures
<p>Job-family structures as illustrated in Figure 19.10 resemble career structures, in that separate
families are identified and levels of knowledge, skills and competency requirements defined
for each level, thus indicating career paths and providing the basis for grading jobs by match-
ing role profiles to level definitions. Like career families, job families may have different
numbers of levels depending on the range of responsibility they cover.</p>

<p>job families
<p>Figure 19.10 A job-family structure
<p>The difference between a career-family structure and a job-family structure is that in the
former there is a common grade and pay structure. Jobs in the same level in each career family
are deemed to be the same size as assessed by job evaluation, and the pay ranges in corre-
sponding levels across the career families are the same. In contrast, the families in a job-family
structure have in effect their own pay structures that take account of different levels of market
rates between families (this is sometimes called &lsquo;market grouping&rsquo;). The size of jobs and rates
of pay can vary between the same levels in different job families, which means that there may
be no read-across between them unless they are underpinned by job evaluation. Because they
may cover a number of market groups, there are often more families in a job-family structure
than in a career-family structure.
<p>Advantages and disadvantages
<p>Job-family structures can help organizations to flex rates of pay for different occupations to
reflect variations in market rates and therefore provide for competitive pay to attract and
retain people with essential skills. They can also indicate career paths within and, to a certain
extent, between families.
<p>But they can result in unequal pay for work of equal value between job families. This can arise
if jobs of the same size are paid differently when pay levels vary between families to cater for
market rate pressures. Such variations may be difficult to justify objectively because the market </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>316 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>pay differentials in job-family structures are common to a whole family. In other structures,
including career-family structures, the alternative and preferable approach is to use market
supplements, which are easier to justify on an individual basis. Pay inequities in job-family
structures can also arise because of read-across difficulties when trying to assess the relative
size of jobs in different families. In theory this problem can be solved by the use of job evalu-
ation but in practice this is difficult when there are considerable differences in the structure
and definition of family levels.
<p>In addition, like career-family structures, job families can be more difficult to develop, explain
and manage than single grade structures.
<p>Examples
Job-family structure at BT
<p>The overall objective of setting up the new grade and pay structure in BT was to be simple and
complete, avoiding over-complicated structures. More specifically, the company decided to
opt for a system of job families in order to:
<p>achieve internal consistency of reward in alignment with external market rates; &bull;
<p>ensure that status, rank and relative position within hierarchies will become less impor- &bull;
tant than what an individual achieves;
<p>help to clarify the roles and potential career paths available to individuals, particularly &bull;
within a job family and, to a certain extent, between families;
<p>offer visibility of roles and salary ranges across other job families; &bull;
<p>achieve more flexibility in managing reward for different occupations to reflect differ- &bull;
ences in market rates and therefore provide for competitive pay to attract and retain
people with essential skills.
<p>The job-family structure was developed to replace a traditional graded structure containing
eight core grades together with a separate sales structure. Ranges were &lsquo;quite broad&rsquo; with sig-
nificant overlap. According to the Connect trade union, there were &lsquo;deep-rooted problems&rsquo;
with the system. In what was once a typical multi-graded pay structure the emphasis was very
much on hierarchy: the only way ahead was upward, through promotion or re-grading. The
focus is now on flexible roles and the individual&rsquo;s contribution in the role, and more priority
is given to external competitiveness. A salary range provides BT line managers with flexibility
in managing reward within their teams. Gone are the days when pay progression and career
development at BT were simply a matter of getting promotion to a higher grade.</p>

<p>A job-family structure in the Financial Services Authority (FSA)
<p>The FSA has 12 job families that vary in size from the 38 people in economics and research to
900 in regulatory. Within each job family there are a number of broad levels, ranging from
four to six according to the family. The levels reflect the different contributions that individu-
als make according to their skills, knowledge and experience, and the roles they perform.
<p>Each level has an associated indicative pay range that has been determined by comparing levels
in the markets in which the FSA competes for staff. Pay ranges are used rather than a specific
rate for the job, to reflect that there is no single market rate of pay for a given job. Instead,
there is a range of pay in the market related to the specific backgrounds, experience and deliv-
ery of individuals performing the roles. The broad overlapping ranges are designed to give
management the flexibility to reflect the differences in contribution that individuals are
making.
<p>A job-family structure at IMS Health
<p>An example of a job-family approach is provided by IMS Health, a global business providing
information for pharmaceutical companies that employs a large proportion of scientists. The
aim of the development programme was &lsquo;to evolve a system which could be flexible enough to
cope with the ever-changing business environment we were in&rsquo;. The reason for going down
the job-family route was that it would give IMS Health the flexibility needed, bearing in mind
the different functions operating in the organization. Defining career paths was an important
consideration affecting the decision to develop job families, as was the need to focus on estab-
lishing appropriate pay levels in each job family that were related to market rates. The progres-
sion policy is for a personal development plan to be prepared for individuals who were
recruited to a role below the reference point that would enable them to reach the level of com-
petence required. A salary development plan would also be prepared to bring up the individ-
ual&rsquo;s rate of pay to the reference point. Progression to the reference point (in effect
competence-related pay) is determined by managers within their budgets. Individuals were
briefed during induction both on the career opportunities available to them and the reward
associated with their progress.
<p>A job-family structure at Kent County Council
<p>Jobs are allocated to one of 35 generic job profiles organized into seven job families. They were

descriptions of these grades have been written to provide staff with a better understanding of
why their job falls in a particular grade, and the analytical points factor system ensures that
staff are all evaluated on a fair and equal basis.</p>

<p>318 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>A job-family structure at Nationwide
<p>Nationwide decided to opt for a system of job families because they:
<p>offer the flexibility to respond to occupational and labour market pressures, in contrast &bull;
to more rigid systems where market rates may fall outside the grading structure;
<p>encourage flexible working practices and multiskilling; &bull;
<p>encourage people to move jobs and build up a broad base of skills in different areas &bull;
while still remaining in the same job family, although there must be flexibility in the
pay ranges to reward people for this;
<p>clarify routes to career progression; &bull;
<p>flatten the organizational structure, driving accountability down to the lowest pos- &bull;
sible level so that the person dealing with the customers is empowered to solve their
problems.
<p>The job-family structure was developed following a detailed analysis of work. Jobs across the
whole organization were found to fall into three broad areas &ndash; customer service, support serv-
ices and specialist advice &ndash; providing the basis on which to group roles into job families. The
project considered whether to construct families on the basis of function or on the basis of
similarities in the nature of people&rsquo;s work. The latter was chosen as it was believed that this
would help to keep the number of families to a minimum. It was subsequently decided to base
the new structure on 11 job families, each with five levels reflecting the extent of employees&rsquo;
decision-making responsibilities, which range from level 1, where decision making extends
over a few days or weeks to level 5, director level, where strategic decision making involves
tasks with a time span of between one and five years.
<p>Combined career/job-family and broad-banded
structures
<p>It is possible to combine career or job-family structures with broad-banded structures. This
can be done by superimposing a broad-banded structure on career/job families, as illustrated
in Figure 19.11. In effect this means that in each job or career family the levels are restricted to
four or five rather than the more typical seven or eight.
<p>Another approach to the combination of family and broad-banded structures is to divide each
band in a broad-banded structure into job families, as illustrated in Figure 19.12. This enables
internal and external relativities to be dealt with individually for each family and also identifies
career paths within families.</p>

<p>320 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Pay spines
<p>Pay spines are found in the public sector or in agencies and charities that have adopted a
public sector approach to reward management. They consist of a series of incremental &lsquo;pay
points&rsquo; extending from the lowest to the highest-paid jobs covered by the structure, as illus-
trated in Figure 19.13. Typically, pay spine increments are between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent.
They may be standardized from the top to the bottom of the spine, or the increments may vary
at different levels, sometimes widening towards the top. Job grades are aligned to the pay
spine, and the pay ranges for the grades are defined by the relevant scale of pay points. The
width of grades can vary and job families may have different pay spines. Progression through
a grade is based on service, although an increasing number of organizations provide scope for
accelerating increments or providing additional increments above the top of the scale for the
grade to reward contribution or merit.
<p>Advantages and disadvantages of pay spines
<p>The advantages of pay spines are first that they just about manage themselves. Either no deci-
sions on pay progression have to be made by management and line managers, or decisions on
extra increments, if they are provided for, are made within an explicit framework. Addition-
ally, because the need for managers to make possibly biased or inconsistent judgements on pay
increases does not exist or is severely limited, they give the impression of being fairer than
structures where progression is governed by managerial decisions on performance or contri-
bution. For this reason they are favoured by trade unions and many managements in the
public sector.

<p>Grade and Pay Structures 321
<p>The disadvantages are that: 1) relating pay almost entirely to service means that people are
rewarded for &lsquo;being there&rsquo; and not for the value of their contribution, 2) pay spines can be
costly in organizations with low staff turnover where everyone drifts to the top of the scale,
and 3) where there are a large number of incremental points in the scale, equal value compli-
cations can arise as men progress to the top while the progress of women is delayed because of
career breaks. For this reason the Local Government Pay Commission recommended a move
away from service-related increments to pay for contribution, restricting increments to the
first few years in a job.
<p>Spot rates
<p>Some organizations do not have a graded structure at all for any jobs, or for certain jobs such
as directors. Instead they use &lsquo;spot rates&rsquo;. These may also be called the &lsquo;rate for the job&rsquo;, more
typically for manual jobs where there is a defined skilled or semi-skilled market rate, which
may be negotiated with a trade union. Spot rates are quite often used in retail firms such as
B&amp;Q for customer service staff (see Chapter 21).
<p>Spot rates are sometimes attached to a person rather than a job. Unless they are negotiated,
rates of pay and therefore relativities are governed by market rates and managerial judgement.
Spot rates are not located within grades and there is no defined scope for progression while on
the spot rate. There may, however, be scope for moving on to higher spot rates as skill, com-
petence or contribution increases. Job holders may be eligible for incentive bonuses on top of
the spot rate.
<p>Spot rates can be used where there is a very simple hierarchy of jobs, as in some manufacturing
and retailing companies. They may be adopted by organizations that want the maximum
amount of scope to pay what they like. They often exist in small or start-up organizations that
do not want to be constrained by a formal grade structure and prefer to retain the maximum
amount of flexibility. But they can result in serious inequities that may be difficult to justify.
<p>Individual job grades
<p>Individual job grades are, in effect, spot rates to which a defined pay range of, say, 20 per cent
on either side of the rate has been attached to provide scope for pay progression based on per-
formance, competence or contribution. Again, the mid-point of the range is fixed by reference
to job evaluation and market rate comparisons.
<p>Individual grades are attached to jobs not persons but there may be more flexibility for move-
ment between grades than in a conventional grade structure. This can arise when people have
expanded their role and it is considered that this growth in the level of responsibility needs to </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>322 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>be recognized without having to upgrade the job. Individual job grades may be restricted to
certain jobs, for example more senior managers, where flexibility in fixing and increasing rates
of pay is felt to be desirable. They provide for greater flexibility than more conventional struc-
tures but can be difficult to manage and justify and can result in pay inequities. As described
earlier in this chapter, the &lsquo;zones&rsquo; that are often established in broad-banded structures have
some of the characteristics of individual job grades.
<p>Choice of grade and pay structures
<p>There is a choice among the different types of structures. Their advantages and disadvantages
are summarized in Table 19.3 and this is followed in Table 19.4 by an assessment of the criteria

<p>Table 19.4 Grade and pay structures: criteria for choice
<p>Type of
structure
<p>Criteria for choice &ndash; the structure may be considered more
appropriate when:
<p>Narrow-graded The organization is large and bureaucratic with well defined and &bull;
extended hierarchies.
<p>Pay progression is expected to occur in small but relatively frequent &bull;
steps.
<p>The culture is one in which much significance is attached to status as &bull;
indicated by gradings.
<p>Some but not too much scope for pay progression is wanted. &bull;
<p>Broad-graded It is believed that if there is a relatively limited number of grades it &bull;
will be possible to define and therefore differentiate them more
accurately as an aid to better precision when grading jobs.
<p>An existing narrow-graded structure is the main cause of grade drift. &bull;
It is considered that pay progression through grades can be related to &bull;
contribution and that it is possible to introduce effective control
mechanisms.
<p>Broad-banded Greater flexibility in pay determination and management is required. &bull;
It is believed that job evaluation should no longer drive grading &bull;
decisions.
<p>The focus is on rewarding people for lateral development. &bull;
The organization has been de-layered. &bull;
<p>Career family There are distinct families, and different career paths within and &bull;
between families can be identified and defined.
<p>There is a strong emphasis on career development in the &bull;
organization.
<p>Robust methods of defining competencies exist. &bull;
<p>Job family There are distinct market groups that need to be rewarded differently. &bull;
The range of responsibility and the basis upon which levels exist vary &bull;
between families.
<p>It is believed that career paths need to be defined in terms of &bull;
competence requirements.
<p>Pay spine This is the traditional approach in a public or voluntary sector &bull;
organization and it fits the culture.
<p>It is believed to be impossible to measure different levels of &bull;
contribution fairly and consistently.
<p>Ease of administration is an important consideration. &bull;</p>

<p>Grade and Pay Structures 325
<p>Approaches to the design of the most popular types of structure, namely broad-graded and
career family, are described below.
<p>Developing a grade and pay structure
<p>This section describes how two of the most popular types of structure &ndash; broad-graded and
career family &ndash; can be developed. Whichever structure is selected, there will be a number of
design options. These comprise the number of grades, bands or levels, the width of the grades
(the span of pay ranges), the differentials between grades, the degree to which there should be
overlap between grades, if any, and the method of pay progression within grades. In career-
family structures there are options concerning the number of families, the composition of
families and the basis upon which levels should be defined. The options are summarized in
Table 19.5.

<p>Decisions on where grade boundaries should be placed following a job &bull;
evaluation exercise that has produced a ranked order of jobs &ndash; this
might identify the existence of clearly defined clusters of jobs at the
various levels in the hierarchy between which there are significant
differences in job size.
<p>The problem of &lsquo;grade drift&rsquo; (unjustified upgradings in response to &bull;
pressure, lack of promotion opportunities or because job evaluation
has been applied laxly), which can be increased if there are too many
narrow grades.
<p>Pay range

<p>Views on the scope that should be allowed for performance, &bull;

<p>Equal pay considerations &ndash; wide spans, especially extended &bull;
incremental scales, are a major cause of pay gaps between men and
women because women, who are more likely to have career breaks
than men, may not have the same opportunity as men to progress to
the upper regions of the range.

<p>326 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Design feature Design considerations
<p>Differentials
between pay
ranges
<p>Differentials between pay ranges should provide scope to recognize &bull;
increases in job size between successive grades.
<p>If differentials are too close &ndash; less than 10 per cent &ndash; many jobs &bull;
become borderline cases, which can result in a proliferation of appeals
and arguments about grading.
<p>Large differentials below senior management level of more than 25 per &bull;
cent can create problems for marginal or borderline cases because of
the amount at stake.
<p>In most organizations with conventional grade structures a differential &bull;
of between 15 and 20 per cent is appropriate except, perhaps, at the
highest levels.
<p>Pay range
overlap
<p>There is a choice on whether or not pay ranges should overlap and, if &bull;
so, by how much.
<p>Large overlaps of more than 10 per cent can create equal pay problems &bull;
where, as is quite common, men are clustered at the top of their
grades and women are more likely to be found at the lower end.
<p>Pay
progression
<p>There is a choice of methods of pay progression between the various &bull;
forms of contingent pay, namely performance, contribution or
competence-related as described in Chapter 10, and the fixed service-
related increments common in the public sector.
<p>The steps required to design graded and career-family pay structures are described below.
<p>Graded pay structure design
<p>Graded pay structure involves first designing the grade structure and then deciding on the pay
ranges that should be attached to it.
<p>The two approaches to designing the grade structure are: 1) the derived method in which deci-
sions on the grade structure are led by point-factor job evaluation; and 2) the pre-emptive
method in which the number of grades is determined first and each grade is then defined as a
basis for analytical matching or market pricing.
<p>The derived method (use of point-factor job evaluation)
<p>The derived method consists of the following steps:
<p>1. Use point-factor job evaluation to produce a rank order of jobs according to their job
evaluation scores.
<p>Table 19.5 continued</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 327
<p>2. Either (a) take a preliminary view on the preferred number of grades or (b) analyse the
rank order to establish by inspection where jobs might be grouped into grades and how
many grades emerge from this procedure.
<p>3. Decide where the boundaries that will define grades should be placed in the rank order
(guidelines on defining boundaries are given in Figure 19.14).
<p>4. Remember that, so far as possible, the grade boundaries in the rank order should divide
groups or clusters of jobs that are significantly different in size, so that all the jobs placed
in a grade are clearly smaller than the jobs in the next higher grade and larger than the jobs
placed in the next lower grade.
<p>Table 19.6 Method of deciding on grade boundaries
<p>Analyse the rank order to identify any significant gaps in the points scores between
adjacent jobs. These natural breaks in points scores will then constitute the boundaries
between clusters of jobs which can be allocated to adjacent grades. This is the preferred
approach but in many cases there will be no significant gaps. If so, the following method
can be used:
<p>Jobs with common features as indicated by the job evaluation factors are grouped &bull;
together so that a distinction can be made between the characteristics of the jobs in
different grades &ndash; it should be possible to demonstrate that the jobs grouped into one
grade resemble each other more than they resemble jobs placed in adjacent grades.
<p>The grade hierarchy should take account of the organizational hierarchy, ie jobs in &bull;
which the job holder reports to a higher level job holder should be placed in a lower
grade although this principle should not be followed slavishly when an organization is
over-hierarchical with, perhaps, a series of one-over-one reporting relationships.
<p>The boundaries should not be placed between jobs mainly carried out by men and jobs &bull;
mainly carried out by women.
<p>The boundaries should ideally not be placed immediately above jobs in which large &bull;
numbers of people are employed because this will result in a large number of appeals
against the grading.
<p>The grade width in terms of job evaluation points should represent a significant step in &bull;
demands on job holders as indicated by the job evaluation scheme.
<p>The grades in a structure established in this manner can be defined in the form of grade pro-
files using the job evaluation factors as the headings for each profile. These can form the basis
for analytical matching.
<p>Pre-emptive method
<p>The pre-emptive method takes place in the following steps:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>328 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>1. Assume number of grades. The assumption on how many grades are required is based on
an analysis of the existing hierarchy of jobs and a judgement on how many levels are
needed to produce a logical grouping of those jobs, level by level. A logical grouping is one
in which each grade contains jobs whose levels are broadly comparable and there is a step
difference in the degree of responsibility between each level.
<p>2. Define grades. There is a choice between a simple non-analytical or semi-analytical job
classification approach and a full analytical approach. The job classification approach
involves preparing an overall definition of the grade to enable &lsquo;job slotting&rsquo; to take place.
This means slotting &lsquo;whole jobs&rsquo;, ie ones that have not been analysed under job evaluation
factor headings, to grades by comparing the whole-job description with grade. A full ana-
lytical approach involves the preparation of grade profiles. These use job evaluation factors
as the headings for the profile of each grade, which can be compared with role profiles set
out under the same headings so that analytical matching can take place.
<p>3. Revise initial assumption as necessary. The process of definition may reveal that the
number of grades assumed to be required initially was either too many (the distinctions
between them cannot be made with sufficient clarity) or too few (it becomes apparent that
the range of jobs to be fitted into the structure is too great to be accommodated into the
number of grades available). If this is the case, the number of grades would have to be
adjusted iteratively until a satisfactory result is obtained.
<p>4. Match benchmark jobs. The benchmark jobs are matched to grades in accordance with a
pre-determined analytical matching protocol, as described in the job evaluation toolkit.
When matched, the information on the benchmark roles may suggest changes to the grade
profiles, which would thus become even more realistic.
<p>5. Match remaining roles. The remaining roles can be matched to the grade profiles using
the protocol. A confirmation of the match can be obtained by comparing them with the
graded benchmark roles.
<p>Pay range design
<p>The steps required to determine pay ranges are:
<p>1. Obtain information on the market rates for benchmark jobs where available. If possible
this should indicate the median rate and the upper and lower quartiles. Remember that
there may be some key jobs for which market rate data is not available.
<p>2. List the jobs within each grade on the basis of job evaluation (these might be limited to
benchmark jobs that have been evaluated but there must be an adequate number of them
if a proper basis for the design is to be provided).
<p>3. Establish the actual rates of pay of the job holders.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 329
<p>4. For each grade set out the range of pay for job holders and calculate their average or
median rate of pay (the pay practice point). It is helpful to plot this pay practice data as
illustrated in Figure 19.14, which shows pay in each grade against job evaluation scores
and includes a pay practice trend line.
<p>5. Agree policy on how the organization&rsquo;s pay levels should relate to market rates &ndash; its
&lsquo;market stance&rsquo;. This could be at the median, or above the median if it is believed that pay
levels should be more competitive.
<p>6. Calculate the average market rates for the benchmark jobs in each grade according to pay
stance policy, eg the median rates. This produces the range market reference point.

<p>7. Compare the practice and market reference points in each range and decide on the range
reference point. This usually becomes the mid-point of the pay range for the grade and is
regarded as the competitive rate for a fully competent job holder in that grade. This is a
judgemental process that takes into account the difference between the practice and policy
points, the perceived need to be more competitive if policy rates are higher, and the likely
costs of increasing rates.
<p>8. Examine the pay differentials between reference points in adjacent grades. These should
provide scope to recognize increases in job size, and, so far as possible, variations between
differentials should be kept to a minimum. If differentials are too close &ndash; less than 10 per
cent &ndash; many jobs become borderline cases, which can result in a proliferation of appeals
and arguments about grading. Large differentials below senior management level of more
than 25 per cent can create problems for marginal or borderline cases because of the
amount at stake. Experience has shown that in most organizations with conventional
grade structures a differential of between 15 and 20 per cent is appropriate except, perhaps,
at the highest levels.
<p>9. Decide on the range of pay around the reference point. This might be 20 per cent on either
side of the reference point; thus if that point is 100 per cent, the range is from 80 per cent
to 120 per cent. The range can, however, vary in accordance with policy on the scope for
progression and, if a given range of pay has to be covered by the structure, the fewer the
grades the wider the ranges.
<p>10. Decide on the extent, if any, to which pay ranges should overlap. Overlap recognizes that
an experienced job holder at the top of a range may be making a greater contribution than
an inexperienced job holder at the lower end of the range above. Large overlaps of more
than 10 per cent can create equal pay problems where men are at the top of their grades
and women are likely to be found at the lower end.
<p>11. Review the impact of the above pay range decisions on the pay of existing staff in order to
calculate implementation costs. Establish the number of staff whose present rate of pay is
above or below the pay range for the grade into which their jobs have been placed, and the
extent of the difference between the rate of pay of those below the minimum and the
lowest point of that pay range. Calculate the costs of bringing them up to the minimum.
Software such as the pay modellers produced by Link and Pilat or locally tailored Excel
spreadsheets can be used for this purpose.
<p>When the above steps have been completed, it may be necessary to review the decisions made
on the grade structure and pay reference points and ranges, especially when the costs calcu-
lated in Stage 11 are too high. Iteration is almost always necessary to obtain a satisfactory result
that conforms to the criteria for grade and pay structures mentioned earlier and minimizes the
cost of implementation. Alternatives can be modelled using the software mentioned above.</p>

<p>Grade and Pay Structures 331
<p>Career-family structure design
<p>The steps required to design a career-family structure are:
<p>1. Select and define career families.
<p> Decide on what career families are required. Typically, not more than four or five families
are identified. The choice of families is between functions, such as marketing or finance,
and activities, such as administration and support staff, or a combination of functions and
activities.
<p>2. Decide on the number of levels in the career-family structure and define them with level
profiles.
<p> Level profiles are required that apply to all the families in the structure, bearing in mind
that the defining characteristic of a career family is that the levels and the pay ranges
attached to them are common to all the families in the structure (as distinct from job-
family structures in which levels and ranges differ between some or all of the families).
<p>3. Identify, define and match benchmark roles.
<p> A representative sample of benchmark roles are identified, defined as role profiles and
matched with the level profiles as described above for a graded structure.
<p>4. Conduct analytical matching.
<p> Analytical matching procedures are used to allocate the remaining roles to levels. It is
advisable to test the process first in one family; this will not only test the procedure but
will also enable model career-family structures to be used when dealing with the other
career families.
<p>5. Attach pay ranges to levels.
<p> Pay ranges are established for each level, as described above for graded structures.
<p>6. Validate relativities between career families.
<p> The allocation of jobs to levels through matching across the career families is validated by
reference to job evaluation scores to ensure that the relativities between them look reason-
able. Some adjustment may need to be made as a result of this cross-check if it exposes
inequities between families.</p>

<p>Developing a grade and pay structure: six tips
Involve stakeholders (top management, line managers and staff) in drawing up &bull;
guiding principles on the design and operation of the structure.
<p>Analyse the options available and select one that meets the guiding principles &bull;
and fits the values and methods of work in the business.
<p>Keep it as simple as possible. &bull;
<p>Ensure that good data are available on which to base the design (job evaluation &bull;
and market rates).
<p>Obtain the buy-in of stakeholders. &bull;
<p>Communicate very widely and very often what is being done and why. &bull;

<p>Introduction
<p>Probably no aspect of remuneration has attracted as much attention recently as that of the pay
of directors and senior executives, especially since the 2008/09 banking crisis. Searching ques-
tions are being asked frequently about the level of remuneration, the basis upon which pay
decisions are made, the conditions for earning bonuses, and pension arrangements.
<p>This chapter starts with a review of the issues surrounding executive pay: What is the problem?
What are the factors affecting executive pay? Why has it grown so much? Decisions on the pay
of directors and, to a degree, senior executives are influenced by corporate governance consid-
erations and the associated codes, as described in the next part of the chapter. The final section
examines the different aspects of remuneration packages for directors and senior executives,
namely base pay, incentives, benefits and service contracts.
<p>Executive pay levels
<p>According to Duncan Brown (2009), executive pay is out of control. As reported by Seager and
Finch in The Guardian in September 2009, the think tank Compass has established that the
average ratio of chief executive-to-employee pay has risen from 47 to 128 over the past 10
years. A non-executive director interviewed by Perkins and Hendry (2005) during their
research on top pay remarked: &lsquo;There is neither a moral nor a market argument to justify the
explosion in pay, but once started, it is hard to stop. You cannot be seen to be left out.&rsquo;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">

<p>Rewarding Directors and Senior Executives 337
<p>It has been established by research (Conyon and Leech, 1994; Gomez-Mejia and Balkin, 1992;
Gregg et al 1993) that there is no evidence that the huge increases in pay have resulted in
improved company performance. Timothy Garton Ash (2009) commented that:
<p>The conduct of the bankers who pitched us into the slurry pit &ndash; not all bankers of course,
but quite a few of them &ndash; may not have been illegal but it was selfish, irresponsible and
immoral. Year after year they took huge personal gains for themselves on the basis of
assets whose real nature and prospects they either did not understand or cynically
ignored. Their pay and bonuses, out of all proportion to the sums almost everyone else
was earning in the societies around them, were justified as &lsquo;performance-related&rsquo;, but
&lsquo;performance&rsquo; was measured by inadequate indicators over too short a time-frame.
Remuneration at the top was based on competitive benchmarking against rivals, and
big shots were heard to complain that it was &lsquo;unfair&rsquo; that someone else was earning
&pound;5m a year while they were only earning &pound;4 million a year.
<p>Factors affecting the level and nature of executive
rewards
<p>The five factors are agency theory, tournament theory, market forces, the perceived inherent
value of chief executives and the operation of remuneration committees.
<p>Agency theory
<p>The basic proposition of agency theory is that the only way in which owners (principals) can
get loyalty from their managers (agents) is by paying them more. This is because owners do
not have complete control over their managers and the latter may act in their own interests
and not those of the owners. It is therefore desirable to operate a system of financial incentives
to motivate behaviour and generate results that are in the interests of the owners. This is called
&lsquo;incentive alignment&rsquo;.
<p>Gomez-Mejia et al (2005) suggested that agency theory does not assume opportunism on the
part of the agent, but simply that the agent has self-interest, which can manifest as opportun-
ism under certain conditions. Opportunism is defined as: &lsquo;The adaptation of one&rsquo;s actions to
circumstances in order to further one&rsquo;s immediate interests, without regard for basic princi-
ples or consequences&rsquo;.
<p>According to Perkins and Hendry (2005):
<p>Agency problems arise for investors in assessing whether they are getting the best return
from the executives to whom the firm&rsquo;s management is delegated [who can in effect act </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>338 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>as the dominant stakeholder]. If it were easy to assure alignment between payments
(inputs) to executives and performance (outputs), shareholders could simply pay their
executives a fixed salary (in effect, a form of insurance payment), and then assess
whether that agent is supplying optimal effort in the shareholder&rsquo;s interest. That not
being the case, they resort (according to the theory) to forms of variable performance-
related pay.
<p>It has been suggested by Bruce et al (2005) that this provides rewards for risk-taking.
<p>Tournament theory
<p>Tournament theory explains that the remuneration of a chief executive is in effect a prize and
executives expend effort to increase the likelihood of winning it. As Conyon et al (2001) note,
the theory explains that: &lsquo;Analogous to a sports game, what matters for winning is not the
absolute level of performance, but how well one does in relation to the other competitors.&rsquo; The
effect is that the relationship between organizational and pay levels is convex, with a consider-
ably greater gap between the next-to-highest and the highest levels.
<p>Market forces
<p>The way market forces work in executive pay tends to be through &lsquo;comparisons with other
executives in relevant industry labour markets&rsquo; (Stiles and Taylor, 2002). Thus, the Hampel
Report (1998) stated that British boardroom remuneration will be &lsquo;largely determined by the
market&rsquo;, although the earlier Greenbury Report (1995) argued that the market was imperfect
and only set a broad framework.
<p>Data collected by Perkins and Hendry (2005) over 10 years for 81 of the FTSE 100 companies
tended to show a relative lack of intra-company movement among executive directors, in par-
ticular internationally. This, they commented, undermines the presumption of a market in
executives and hence in executive pay. They went on to point out that: &lsquo;While the evidence for
a market with price as a clearing mechanism remains questionable, therefore, there is certainly
no widespread subjective sense of such a market among those who are closest to it. Rather,
there are a series of localized bargains.&rsquo; They quoted a remuneration committee member they
interviewed who categorically denied the existence of a recognizable market for executives,
&lsquo;certainly not like that for beef or shares&rsquo;. Instead, he said, there are &lsquo;just key people in unique
positions at a given moment in time, who are not readily interchangeable&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Rewarding Directors and Senior Executives 339
<p>The perceived inherent value of chief executives
<p>The price of chief executives may be influenced by beliefs in their value to the business as the
generators of shareholder value. But as Perkins and Hendry (2005) wrote presciently: &lsquo;There
is more spectacular evidence that misjudged CEO and board decisions contribute far more to
destroying value than creating it (for example, GEC/Marconi, to name but one case).&rsquo; Later
events, notably crises in a number of banks largely due to the activities of their chief executives,
have proved them right.
<p>Remuneration committees
<p>The Committee on Corporate Governance (2000) of the Stock Exchange and other reports
recommended the establishment of remuneration committees to provide an independent
basis for setting the salary levels and the rules covering incentives, share options, benefit enti-
tlements and contract provisions for executive directors. Such committees were to be account-
able to shareholders for the decisions they take and the non-executive directors who sat on
them would have no personal financial interests at stake. They would be constituted as sub-
committees of company boards, and boards should elect both the chairman and the members.
Their essential role would be to set broad policy for executive remuneration as a whole as well
as the remuneration packages of executive directors and, sometimes, other senior executives.
They should consist exclusively of non-executive directors and should determine remunera-
tion policy and the reward packages of individual executive directors, which should appear as
a section in the annual report. This report should include statements on remuneration policy
and the methods used to form that policy and disclose details of the remuneration of individ-
ual directors. The Combined Code of Practice (see later in this chapter) laid down the princi-
ples they should take into account when considering pay levels.
<p>Remuneration committees are now well established as bodies for making recommendations
on directors&rsquo; pay, often with the advice of remuneration consultants. The Combined Code
states that they should avoid paying more than is necessary, and should also be sensitive to pay
and employment conditions elsewhere in the group, especially when determining annual
salary increases. But the extent to which they follow either of these precepts is often question-
able. So is the degree to which they are independent; after all, members of the remuneration
committee are also colleagues of the board members on whose remuneration they deliberate.
<p>As Perkins and Hendry (2005) observed following their discussions with remuneration commit-
tee members, consultants engaged by managements to &lsquo;advise&rsquo; committees were felt to be
encouraging a &lsquo;pernicious process of choosing comparators&rsquo; that &lsquo;just leads to the ratcheting up
of top pay&hellip; The problem becomes particularly acute when companies all strive to achieve the
statistically impossible feat of setting reward levels to locate themselves in the upper quartile of
their benchmark group.&rsquo; They also noted the ambiguities and weaknesses of the non-executive </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>340 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>directors and commented that: &lsquo;The workings of a market in executive pay are fatally under-
mined by the social realities.&rsquo;
<p>Why has executive pay grown so much?
<p>The reasons for the growth in executive rewards as explained by Dymond and Murlis (2009)
are:
<p>Agency theory: shareholders must structure the CEO&rsquo;s compensation arrangements to &bull;
reward behaviours that increase shareholder wealth (this is the most important
reason).
<p>Tournament theory: the high rewards received by CEOs have little to do with what they &bull;
deserve. Rather the main purpose of such rewards is to send signals to senior managers
to motivate them to compete for the number one spot.
<p>The changing nature of companies and the increasing demands made on chief &bull;
executives.
<p>Star culture: the creation of the celebrity CEO. &bull;
<p>The talent shortage. &bull;
<p>Pay disclosure in annual reports lead to demands from CEOs to achieve parity. Hampel &bull;
(1998) noted that a perverse outcome of the requirements for greater disclosure of
directors&rsquo; pay and the administration of salary surveys was to help &lsquo;ratchet up&rsquo; pay
levels among full-time board members.
<p>To which could be added the ways in which remuneration committees can sometimes func-
tion as conduits for pay increases, aided and abetted by remuneration consultants.
<p>Corporate governance and executive remuneration
<p>Corporate governance is the internal set of processes and policies that determine the way a
corporation is directed and controlled, and serve the needs of shareholders and other stake-
holders. It involves the board of a company and includes how members of that board are
remunerated.
<p>It is usually assumed that a company is owned by its shareholders and that the prime, if not the
only responsibility, of its management (ie the board) is to increase the value of the shares
owned by shareholders &ndash; shareholder value. But, as Simon Caulkin (2009) noted: &lsquo;Contrary to
common assumptions, shareholders do not own companies (how could they and benefit from
limited liability at the same time?), and directors owing their duty to the company can&rsquo;t be </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Directors and Senior Executives 341
<p>&ldquo;agents&rdquo; of shareholders &ndash; indeed they are charged with acting fairly as between all company
members.&rsquo; As reported by Caulkin, Professor Bob Garret recently told a meeting of the Human
Capital Forum that the first duty of directors was not to shareholders but to the company
itself: &lsquo;Organizations have to move from agency theory to stewardship theory.&rsquo; The latter is the
theory that managers, left on their own, will act as responsible stewards of the assets they
control on behalf of all stakeholders. This may not necessarily happen in reality, but as an aspi-
ration has more to offer than agency theory.
<p>It follows that focusing only on increasing shareholder value is a questionable approach.
Caulkin quotes Jack Welch, formerly head of GE and the foremost management icon of the
age, as saying that shareholder value &lsquo;is the dumbest idea in the world &ndash; a result not a strategy
&ndash; your main constituents are your employees, customers and products&rsquo;.
<p>The Combined Code on Corporate Governance
<p>Corporations may or may not pursue shareholder value at the expense of good corporate gov-
ernance or stewardship, but their role in general and their specific role in deciding on remu-
neration arrangements for directors has been questioned regularly since 1992 when the
Cadbury committee reported. This was followed by a report from the Greenbury Committee
(1995) and the Hampel Report (1998). These led to The Combined Code on Corporate Gov-
ernance produced by the Financial Reporting Council in 2008, which lays down general prin-
ciples of governance and a number of specific principles relating to the remuneration of
directors. These are:
<p>Levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of &bull;
the quality required to run the company successfully, but a company should avoid
paying more than is necessary for this purpose. A significant proportion of executive
directors&rsquo; remuneration should be structured so as to link rewards to corporate and
individual performance.
<p>The remuneration committee should judge where to position their company relative to &bull;
other companies. But they should use such comparisons with caution, in view of the
risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels with no corresponding improvement
in performance. They should also be sensitive to pay and employment conditions else-
where in the group, especially when determining annual salary increases.
<p>The performance-related elements of remuneration should form a significant propor- &bull;
tion of the total remuneration package of executive directors and should be designed
to align their interests with those of shareholders and to give these directors keen incen-
tives to perform at the highest levels.
<p>The remuneration committee should consider whether the directors should be eligible &bull;
for annual bonuses. If so, performance conditions should be relevant, stretching and </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>342 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>designed to enhance shareholder value. Upper limits should be set and disclosed. There
may be a case for part payment in shares to be held for a significant period.
<p>Payouts or grants under all incentive schemes, including new grants under existing &bull;
share option schemes, should be subject to challenging performance criteria that
reflect the company&rsquo;s objectives. The total rewards potentially available should not
be excessive.
<p>The remuneration committee should consider the pension consequences and associ- &bull;
ated costs to the company of basic salary increases and any other changes in pension-
able remuneration, especially for directors close to retirement.
<p>But it seems that these principles are frequently more honoured in the breach than in the
observance.
<p>The Turner Review
<p>The banking crisis of 2008 prompted the Turner Review, which proposed the following code
of good practice:
<p>Firms must ensure that their remuneration policies are consistent with effective risk &bull;
management.
<p>Remuneration should reflect an individual&rsquo;s record of compliance with risk man- &bull;
agement procedures, rules and appropriate culture, as well as financial measures of
performance.
<p>Financial measures used in remuneration policies should entail the adjustment of &bull;
profit measures to reflect the relative riskiness of different activities.
<p>The predominant share (two-thirds or more) of bonuses that exceed a significant level, &bull;
should be paid in a deferred form (deferred cash or shares), with a deferral period that
is appropriate to the nature of the business and its risks.
<p>Payment of deferred bonuses should be linked to financial performance during the &bull;
deferral period.
<p>Directors&rsquo; and senior executives&rsquo; remuneration
<p>The main elements of directors&rsquo; and senior executives&rsquo; remuneration are basic pay, short and
long-term bonus or incentive schemes, share option and share ownership schemes, benefits
and service contracts. The salary is usually a one-off, negotiated rate and commonly incorpo-
rates a golden hello or pay-off deal. It should be set through a remuneration committee that
meets good practice guidelines.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Directors and Senior Executives 343
<p>Basic pay
<p>Decisions on the base salary of directors and senior executives are usually founded on views
about the market worth of the individuals concerned. Remuneration on joining the company
is commonly settled by negotiation, often subject to the approval of a remuneration commit-
tee. Reviews of base salaries are then undertaken by reference to market movements and
success as measured by company performance. Decisions on base salary are important not
only in themselves but also because the level may influence decisions on the pay of both senior
and middle managers. Bonuses are expressed as a percentage of base salary, share options may
be allocated as a declared multiple of basic pay and, commonly, pension will be a generous
proportion of final salary.
<p>Bonus schemes
<p>Virtually all major employers in the UK (90 per cent according to recent surveys by organiza-
tions such as Monks and Hay) have annual incentive (bonus) schemes for senior executives.
Bonus schemes provide directors and executives with cash sums based on the measures of
company and, frequently, individual performance.
<p>Typically, bonus payments are linked to achievement of profit and/or other financial targets
and they are sometimes &lsquo;capped&rsquo;; that is, a restriction is placed on the maximum amount
payable. There may also be elements related to achieving specific goals and to individual
performance. Bonuses tend to be high &ndash; 70 per cent of base salary or more. They are osten-
sibly intended to motivate directors to achieve performance improvements for the business.
A more common although not always disclosed reason for bonuses is to ensure that what is
believed to be a competitive remuneration package is available: &lsquo;Everyone else is doing it so
we must too.&rsquo;
<p>One of the problems with high bonus expectations is that of the &lsquo;moral hazard&rsquo; involved. For
example, directors might be tempted to manipulate reported profits to drive up the share
price, frequently an important determinant of bonuses. Or they may go for high returns in
risky short-term projects, ignoring the possible downside of longer-term losses.
<p>Long-term bonuses
<p>Cash bonus schemes can be extended over periods of more than one year on the grounds that
annual bonuses focus too much on short-term results. The most common approach to pro-
viding longer-term rewards is through share ownership schemes as described later.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>344 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Deferred bonus schemes
<p>Some companies have adopted deferred bonus schemes under which part of the executive&rsquo;s
annual bonus is deferred for, say, two years. The deferred element is converted into shares,
each of which is matched with an extra, free share on condition the executive remains employed
by the company at the end of the deferral period. Such a scheme is designed to reward per-
formance and loyalty to the company.
<p>Scheme effectiveness
<p>In an effective bonus scheme:
<p>Targets will be tough but achievable. &bull;
<p>The reward should be commensurate with the achievement. &bull;
<p>The targets will be quantified and agreed. &bull;
<p>The measures used will refer to the key factors that affect company performance, and &bull;
these performance areas will be those that can be directly affected by the efforts of those
eligible for bonus payments.
<p>The formula will be simple and clear. &bull;
<p>On the evidence of recent bonus pay-outs to failing company directors, it does not seem that
these criteria are being applied successfully.
<p>Share option schemes
<p>Many companies have share option schemes that give directors and executives the right to buy
a block of shares on some future date at the share price ruling when the option was granted.
They are a form of long-term incentive on the assumption that executives will be motivated to
perform more effectively if they can anticipate a substantial capital gain when they sell their
shares at a price above that prevailing when they took up the option.
<p>Conditions may be laid down to the effect that the company&rsquo;s earnings per share (EPS) growth
should exceed inflation by a set amount over a number of years (often three) and that the
executive remains employed by the company at the exercise date.
<p>The arguments advanced in favour of executive share options are that, first, it is right for exec-
utives to share in the success of their company to which, it is assumed, they have contributed
and, second, they encourage executives to align their interests (incentive alignment) more
closely in the longer term with those of the shareholders as a whole (the latter argument is
based on agency theory although it is quite possible that those who advance it are unaware that
such a thing as agency theory exists). The first point is valid as long as the reward for exercising </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Directors and Senior Executives 345
<p>share options is commensurate with the contribution of the executive to the improved per-
formance of the business. The second point is dubious. The vast majority of shares acquired in
this way are sold almost immediately and the gain is pocketed as extra income.
<p>Share options have been severely criticized recently because of the enormous gains made by
some executives. There is a strong feeling among the major investment institutions that share
options do not achieve community of interest between executives and shareholders and are in
effect no more than a form of cash bonus in which the pay-out has little or nothing to do with
the executive&rsquo;s performance, and indeed can become a reward for failure.
<p>Performance share schemes
<p>Some companies have performance share schemes under which executives are provisionally
awarded shares. The release of the shares is subject to the company&rsquo;s performance, typically
determined on a sliding scale by reference to the company&rsquo;s total shareholder return (a com-
bination of share price growth and dividend yield) ranking against its chosen peer companies
over a three-year period. Release is also conditional on the executive remaining employed by
the company at the vesting date. Such a scheme rewards loyalty to the company and the value
delivered to shareholders in the form of share price performance and dividends but does not
link directly to business performance.
<p>Executive restricted share schemes
<p>Under such schemes free shares are provisionally awarded to participants. These shares do not
belong to the executive until they are released or vested; hence they are &lsquo;restricted&rsquo;. The number
of shares actually released to the executive at the end of a defined period (usually three or, less
commonly, five years) will depend on performance over that period against specific targets.
Thereafter there may be a further retention period when the shares must be held although no
further performance conditions apply.
<p>Benefits
<p>Employee benefits for executives may amount to over 20 per cent of the total reward package.
The most important element is the pension scheme, and directors may be provided with a
much higher accrual rate than in a typical final salary scheme. This means that, typically, the
maximum two-thirds pension can be achieved after 20 years&rsquo; service or even less, rather than
the 40 years it takes in a typical one-sixtieth scheme. Pensions are easily inflated, as in a recent
notorious case, by presenting the departing director with a last-minute substantial increase in
pensionable salary.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>346 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Service contracts
<p>Long-term service contracts for directors have been fairly typical, but they are disliked in the
City because of the high severance payments to departing chief executives and directors that
are made if the contract is two or three years, even when it was suspected or actually the case
that they had been voted off the board because of inadequate performance. Rolling contracts
for directors are now more likely to be restricted to one year.
<p>Rewarding directors: six tips
Follow the principles of corporate governance laid down by the Combined &bull;
Code.
<p>Make decisions on levels of remuneration by reference to objective evidence, &bull;
not hearsay or assumptions.
<p>Justify rates of pay on the basis of the performance of the chief executive or &bull;
director, as demonstrated by the performance of the business.
<p>Ensure that members of the remuneration committee are properly briefed and &bull;
supported in making their recommendations.
<p>Subject all bonus plans to careful scrutiny to ensure that they conform to good &bull;
practice.
<p>Subject proposed bonus payments to rigorous scrutiny to ensure that they &bull;
genuinely reflect the level of performance achieved and do not reward failure.

Rewarding Sales and

<p>Learning outcomes
<p>On completing this chapter you should know about:
<p>Methods of rewarding sales staff &bull; Methods of rewarding customer service &bull;
staff
<p>Introduction
<p>Sales and customer service staff make a strong and immediate impact on business results. This
has led to an emphasis on financial incentives, especially for sales representatives and sales staff
in retailers, who are often treated quite differently from other people. The reward system for
sales and service staff also has to take account of the fact that they are the people who are in
direct contact with customers, and this also applies to people in call centres.
<p>Rewarding sales representatives
<p>Sales representatives are more likely to be eligible for commission payments or bonuses
than other staff on the grounds that their sales performance will depend on or at least be
improved by financial incentives. Many companies believe that the special nature of selling
and the type of person they need to attract to their sales force requires some form of addi-
tional bonus or commission to be paid. The nature of the work of sales representatives
means that it is usually easy to specify targets and measure performance against them, and
sales incentive schemes are therefore more likely to meet the line of sight requirement (ie
that there should be a clear link between effort and performance) than schemes for other
<p>348 </p>

<p>staff such as managers and administrators. Sales staff, including those in retail establish-
ments, are often paid spot rates with a commission on sales.

<p>The approaches to rewarding sales staff described below are:

<p>Table 21.1 summarizes the different schemes, their advantages and disadvantages and when
they may be appropriate.
<p>Salary only
<p>Companies may adopt a salary only (no commission or bonus) approach when sales staff have
little influence over sales volume, when representing the company and generally promoting its
products or services is more important than direct selling, and when the company wants to
encourage sales staff to build up good and long-term relationships with their customers, the
emphasis being on customer service rather than on high-pressure selling.
<p>Basic salary only may also be paid to sales staff who work in highly seasonal industries where
sales fluctuate considerably, and businesses where regular orders for food and other consumer
goods give little opportunity for creative selling.
<p>However, companies that do not pay commission or bonus may have a pay-for-contribu-
tion scheme that provides for consolidated increases based on an assessment of perform-
ance and competence in such areas as teamwork, customer relations, interpersonal skills
and communications. Where sales staff have to work together to achieve results or where it
is difficult to apportion a successful sale to individuals, a team pay approach may be adopted.
Additionally, salary-only sales representatives may be eligible for incentives in the form of
prizes as described later.
<p>If no commission or bonus is offered, it is necessary for companies to ensure that the salaries
paid to their sales staff are competitive. They have to take account of the total earnings of sales
staff in markets from which they recruit people or where their own staff move. If they cannot
or do not want to at least match these earnings they may have to offer other inducements to
join or stay with the company. These can include opportunities for promotion, learning new
skills, more stable pay and greater security.</p>

<p>352 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Basic salary plus commission
<p>Salary plus commission plans provide for a proportion of total earnings to be paid in commis-
sion, while the rest is paid in the form of a fixed salary. The commission is calculated as a per-
centage of the value of sales. The proportion of commission varies widely. As a general rule it
is higher when results depend on the ability and effort of individuals or when there is less
emphasis on non-selling activities. As a rule of thumb, most sales managers believe that the
commission element will not motivate their staff unless they have a reasonable opportunity to
earn at least 20 per cent of base pay.
<p>The commission may be a fixed percentage of all sales, possibly with a &lsquo;cap&rsquo; or upper limit on
earnings. Alternatively the commission rate can increase at higher levels of sales on a rising
scale to encourage sales representatives to make even greater efforts.
<p>Basic salary plus bonus
<p>Cash bonuses may be paid on top of basic salary. They are based on the achievement of targets
or quotas for sales volume, profit or sales &lsquo;contribution&rsquo; (sales revenue minus variable
expenses). They differ from commission payments in that the latter are based simply on a per-
centage of whatever sales have been attained. In a bonus scheme, targets or objectives may be
set just for sales volume but they can also focus on particular aspects of the results that can be
achieved by sales staff that it is felt should be stimulated. These may include the sales of high-
margin or more profitable products or services in order to encourage staff to concentrate on
them rather than simply aiming to achieve sales volume with low-margin products that are
easier to sell. They may also cover reviving moribund accounts, promoting new products and
minimizing bad debt. Other criteria may include the level of customer service, the volume of
repeat business, the number of productive calls made, product knowledge, teamwork and
quality of administration.
<p>There are many ways in which bonuses can be determined. The method used will take into
account the following considerations:
<p>The formula for relating bonuses to sales: a bonus may be triggered when a sales thresh- &bull;
old is reached, with additions related to increased sales directly or on an accelerated
basis.
<p>The size of bonus payments available at different levels of performance. &bull;
<p>The maximum bonus that will be paid out. &bull;
<p>The bonus criteria: sales revenue is often used, but some companies use profit or con- &bull;
tribution to encourage sales representatives to focus on selling high-margin products
rather than going for volume.
<p>Any other factors to be included in the bonus plan such as those mentioned above. &bull;</p>

<p>Rewarding Sales and Customer Service Staff 353
<p>Commission only
<p>Sales staff who are at the &lsquo;hard&rsquo; end of selling (eg double glazing) may only receive a straight
commission based on a percentage of the value of their sales. No basic salary is paid.
<p>Additional non-cash rewards
<p>While it is possible that the prime motivator for a typical sales representative is cash, there are
a number of other effective non-cash ways of providing motivation as described below.
<p>Other means of rewarding sales representatives
<p>Financial rewards are usually important for members of the sales force but there are other
valuable means of recognizing achievement. These include prizes and non-financial forms of
recognition (&lsquo;sales representative of the month&rsquo; etc) and other items in the total reward package
such as opportunities for growth. As pointed out by Gundy (2002):
<p>In assessing how to motivate the sales force, leading companies view commissions
and bonuses as just one tool in the motivational toolbox&hellip; Performance manage-
ment, career pathing and recognition programmes can be powerful ways of produc-
ing and managing sales results. Companies that consider the impact of all these
programmes in the design process are generally more successful in driving both short-
and long-term results.
<p>Other forms of reward are described below.
<p>Gifts and vouchers
<p>Gifts and vouchers provide a tangible means of recognizing achievements. They may be linked
to the achievement of specified targets but should not be restricted too much to the &lsquo;super
sales representatives&rsquo;; the solid dependable salesperson also needs motivating through the rec-
ognition that such incentives provide. Gifts are subject to income tax.
<p>Competitions
<p>Prizes can be awarded to individuals or teams for notable sales achievements, such as bringing
in new business. However, competitions can demotivate those who do not win prizes and they
should be designed to ensure that all those who are doing well feel that they have a good
chance of getting a prize.</p>

</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>354 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Cars as perks
<p>Sales representatives can be motivated by the opportunity to get a bigger and better car if they
are particularly successful. The car may be retained for a defined period and made available
again if the high performance is maintained.
<p>Recognition schemes
<p>Recognition schemes, as described in Chapter 14, are particularly appropriate for sales staff.
Public applause and private thanks are both important.
<p>Effectiveness and use of sales incentives
<p>A survey of the effectiveness of incentive plans by Mercer Human Resource Consulting (2004)
established that: &lsquo;Many organizations feel their plans do not encourage or reward the right
performance. Of equal concern is that many staff do not understand the plan.&rsquo; The survey
found that:
<p>17 per cent of respondents had between five and eight separate reward criteria. &bull;
<p>3 per cent used nine or more performance measures. &bull;
<p>Volume production targets such as sales revenue, gross profit or units sold were the &bull;
most used.
<p>72 per cent used profit targets for sales directors, along with revenue measures in 64 per &bull;
cent of organizations and individual objectives in 60 per cent.
<p>For sales representatives the most widely used measure was sales volume (72 per cent &bull;
of schemes).
<p>Rewarding customer service staff
<p>Customer service staff work mainly in retail establishments and in call or customer contact
centres. Their rewards need to reflect the nature of their duties, ie enhancing levels of cus-
tomer service as well as selling.
<p>Reward practices
<p>The CIPD in conjunction with the Institute of Customer Service commissioned Professor
Michael West and a team from Aston University to investigate how customer service staff were
employed and rewarded (West et al, 2005).</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Sales and Customer Service Staff 355
<p>The 580 staff covered by the research illustrated that front-line customer service workers do
not all conform to the young/female/fleeting image. While 70 per cent were women, their
average age was 34 years and average length of service six years. Eighty per cent were employed
on a full-time basis and just 9 per cent on temporary contracts.
<p>Nor did their typical working environment and conditions reflect the stereotypical &lsquo;sweat-
shop&rsquo; image. While the HR and reward practices varied, working conditions were generally
good and staff rated their supervisors&rsquo; skills, as well as their colleagues and the level of team-
working. Staff benefits such as company pension plans and sick pay schemes were the norm,
as were various training courses.
<p>The pattern of pay practices used by these 15 organizations for front-line staff and their first-
line managers is shown in Table 21.2. Base pay levels were generally competitive for the loca-
tion and sector, and a number mentioned the effect of the national minimum wage.

<p>356 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Most employees in the researched organizations had the opportunity to progress their base
pay on the basis of their performance or competence, either through a range or up a pay spine,
or between grades/levels of job. Such arrangements have generally supplanted &lsquo;spot&rsquo; rate pay
rates for service roles in call centres and retail shops.
<p>At Boots the Chemists, for example, shop staff can progress up through a number of pay points
according to their level of performance and skill &ndash; from entry level, to experienced, to advanced,
to expert/specialist. At B&amp;Q, customer advisors are paid on one of six different spot rates. Pay
progression is based on the acquisition &ndash; and application on the shopfloor &ndash; of skills and
knowledge. There are four additional spot rates beyond the established rate designed to reward
&lsquo;excellence in the role&rsquo;. Each additional level represents an hourly increase up to a maximum
rate. At House of Fraser, employees are allocated to one of four competency bands &ndash; training,
bronze, silver and gold &ndash; with staff assessed for a &lsquo;promotion&rsquo; every six months. At Lands&rsquo; End,
there is a six-grade pay structure for hourly-paid staff, with spot rates for starters.
<p>Low base pay/high commission arrangements were rare amongst the 15 organizations, but
most of them operated variable performance-related pay schemes of some type, which again
has become the norm for service staff today in these contexts, at least in the private sector.
Tesco and John Lewis staff, for example, received company-wide profit sharing payments.
British Gas uses a company-wide balanced scorecard bonus scheme, while Homebase, Asda
and Marks and Spencer use team, store-based schemes. A number of the organizations used
multiple plans.
<p>All forms of performance-related pay and recognition schemes were used more frequently and
more extensively by the highest-performing organizations in the research than amongst the
other participants or amongst UK organizations as a whole. They were twice as likely as other
UK organizations to use individual performance-related pay and various forms of individual
and team non-financial recognition schemes, and five times as likely to use some form of
team/collective bonus scheme as the remaining organizations in the study.
<p>Reward policies in the research study organizations did not by themselves create high cus-
tomer service performance. They operated through the medium of staff perceptions and in a
general work and management context that encouraged positive perceptions and high levels
of staff commitment &ndash; see Figure 21.1. The best organizations recognize that when it comes to
delivering outstanding service, staff perceptions and management practice, rather than fancy
reward and HR strategy statements, plans and policies are what make the difference.</p>

salary), while an emphasis on hard selling may suggest less base pay and more
incentive.

<p>What motivates knowledge workers &bull; Approaches to rewarding knowledge &bull;
workers
<p>Introduction
<p>A knowledge worker was originally defined by Peter Drucker (1988) as someone &lsquo;who knows
more about his or her work than anyone else in the organization&rsquo;. Today, knowledge workers
are generally regarded as people whose work requires a marked degree of expertise. Their work
is defined by the knowledge they need to do it. The term therefore embraces such diverse
groups as academics, accountants, HR professionals, IT specialists, lawyers, media workers
and researchers.
<p> 359</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>360 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Knowledge workers play a steadily increasing part in organizations. According to the gov-
ernment&rsquo;s Occupational Employment Trends and Projections, UK 1982&ndash;2012, by 2012
knowledge workers will have increased from roughly a quarter of all jobs 20 years ago to
almost a half.
<p>The importance of the contribution made by knowledge workers means that attention has to
be given to how reward policies and practices can be developed to attract, retain and motivate
them having taken account of their particular needs. This is an area of reward management
where segmentation may be appropriate. For example, the fluid grading system used in the
scientific civil service allows for much more flexibility in rewarding scientists in line with their
levels of competence rather than by the levels of responsibility that characterize traditional
narrow-graded structures. The requirement to consider how knowledge workers should be
rewarded is studied in this chapter, which starts with an analysis of what motivates them and
then examines the approaches that can be adopted to their rewards.
<p>What motivates knowledge workers?
<p>In the words of Reeves and Knell (2001), it can be said of all knowledge workers that: &lsquo;The
brightest and the best want an intellectual challenge and the chance to keep learning.&rsquo; And
Coyle (2001) explains that: &lsquo;Skilled programmers don&rsquo;t seem to fret about getting enough
money. The more highly valued reward, because it is so much harder to come by, is the esteem
in which they are held by their peer group.&rsquo;
<p>A study by Tampoe (1993) identified four key motivators for knowledge workers:
<p>Personal growth: the opportunity for individuals to fully realize their potential. &bull;
<p>Occupational autonomy: a work environment in which knowledge workers can achieve &bull;
the task assigned to them.
<p>Task achievement: a sense of accomplishment from producing work that is of high &bull;
quality and relevance to the organization.
<p>Money rewards: an income that is a just reward for their contribution to corporate &bull;
success and that symbolizes their contribution to that success.
<p>To which could be added, especially for scientific or research and development workers, the
facilities required to carry out their work and the opportunity to gain recognition and prestige
from their achievements. These may be more significant than financial rewards relating pay to
performance.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Knowledge Workers 361
<p>Approaches to rewarding knowledge workers
<p>Approaches to rewarding knowledge workers are described below under the headings of total
reward, pay flexibility, pay related to competency, and career and job-family structures.
<p>Total reward policies
<p>Taking into account the factors that motivate knowledge workers mentioned above, there is
an overwhelming case for adopting a total reward policy. As explained in Chapter 3, this would
mean focusing on non-financial rewards such as recognition, opportunity to grow and achieve,
and learning and development opportunities as well as financial rewards.
<p>The following are examples of the approach used by two firms employing large numbers of
knowledge workers.
<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb
<p>The pharmaceutical company states that &lsquo;reward is much wider than just paying its staff a
competitive salary.&rsquo; It has designed its total reward package knowing that everyone works for
the company for different reasons and that everyone places a different emphasis on the impor-
tance of each of the elements of total reward &ndash; there is no one-size-fits-all. It has also set out to
use total reward to &lsquo;elevate and differentiate&rsquo; Bristol-Myers Squibb from other companies,
both in the same industry and beyond.
<p>The three elements of total reward are:
<p>Compensation: salary, performance-based bonus and stock options. &bull;
<p>Benefits: non-contributory pension, life cover, private health care, perks and cars. &bull;
<p>Work experience: defined as: &lsquo;All the elements which contribute to providing you with &bull;
an environment that enables you to optimize your contribution to the company and
achieve your full potential, whilst maintaining a balance between your personal and
professional life&rsquo;. These include:
<p>acknowledgement, appreciation and recognition; &ndash;
<p>balance of work and life; &ndash;
<p>culture of Bristol-Myers Squibb; &ndash;
<p>employee development; &ndash;
<p>the working environment. &ndash;
<p>The total reward approach at Bristol-Myers Squibb embraces what they call the &lsquo;work
experience&rsquo;, described above. This, says the company, to its staff &lsquo;recognizes that you are </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>362 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>an individual with unique needs and offers something for everyone&rsquo;. Work experience
comprises acknowledgement, appreciation and recognition, balance of work and life,
organizational culture, employee development and the working environment.
<p>Elan Computers
<p>The company&rsquo;s approach to total reward stresses investment in people, recognition, the quality
of life and fair and competitive reward. It is part of Elan&rsquo;s people strategy, the stated aims of
which are to:
<p>Support the group vision, to invest in talented people, and to maintain a people-focused
environment that is fun, challenging and rewarding. Starting with our comprehensive
induction programme, we aim to secure long term commitment and inspire enthusi-
asm from day one. And we never stop listening to people. People are given the opportu-
nity every year to take part in a survey to give feedback on every aspect of their life at
Elan, and there are open question and answer sessions with board members. And to
ensure that we are doing what we can to keep the best people, we study the reasons why
people leave, and what retains our most talented people. This strategy allows us to con-
tinually improve our position as an employer and as a market force.
<p>The complete package, the concept of which is based on employees understanding the total
value of all the rewards they receive, not just the individual elements, is designed to attract,
retain, motivate and develop the best talent. The proposition for employees is that &lsquo;TotalRe-
ward&rsquo; gives them the opportunity to share in the company&rsquo;s success, makes it easier to balance
home and working life, and helps them to take care of themselves and their families.
<p>Pay flexibility
<p>The overall approach to rewarding knowledge workers should be flexibility within a frame-
work. This means that a common framework of reward policies exists across the organization
but within that framework some segmentation, as described in Chapter 28, can take place.
This would involve tailoring arrangements to suit the specific needs of particular groups of
knowledge and professional workers and the individuals within those groups. Pay flexibility
could include market rate supplements to attract and retain specific categories of staff and the
use of selected &lsquo;market groups&rsquo; (separate pay structures for certain types of staff). This is in
accord with the view expressed by Lawler (2002) that there should be a move away from job-
based pay to person-based pay related to the market value of a person&rsquo;s skills and knowledge.
On a wider scale, career or job families can be installed as described in Chapter 19.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Knowledge Workers 363
<p>Pay related to competency
<p>If knowledge workers exist to apply their expertise then it seems reasonable to reward them
according to the level of expertise (competency) they possess and apply. There are three ways
of doing this, as described below: 1) by competency-related pay, 2) through structures in
which grades or bands are defined in competency terms, and 3) the incorporation of skills and
competencies into job evaluation factor plans.
<p>Competency-related pay
<p>In a competency-related pay scheme, people receive financial rewards in the shape of increases
to their base pay by reference to the level of competence they demonstrate in carrying out their
roles. It is a method of paying people for the ability to perform now and in the future. This
seems to be a highly relevant approach for knowledge workers but there are measurement
problems that have restricted its use.
<p>Competency defined grade and pay structures
<p>Job or career family structures typically define levels in terms of competencies.
<p>Use of competencies in job evaluation
<p>Traditional job evaluation schemes have always incorporated competencies in their factor
plans, although they called them knowledge, skill or know-how. Factor plans have recently
been developed that deliberately include competencies. This has applied in sectors or organi-
zations such as higher education (the HERA scheme), the senior civil service (the JESP system)
and the NHS, where there are 16 measurement factors but the knowledge, skills and experi-
ence factor accounts for almost a quarter of the total points weighting. This scheme acknowl-
edges the explicit bias towards knowledge in an organization with huge numbers of professional
workers.
<p>Job and career families
<p>Job and career-family structures as described in Chapter 19 consist of separate families of jobs
with similar characteristics. Within each family the successive levels of competency required
to carry out typical activities are defined, thus indicating career paths. In a job-family structure
such as that at Canon UK or Norwich Union Insurance, each job family has its own pay struc-
ture, which takes account of different levels of market rates between families (this is some-
times called &lsquo;market grouping&rsquo;). In a career-family structure as at Southampton University,
the ranges of pay for each family are the same and the emphasis is on defining career progres-
sion rather than market pricing, although market supplements may be paid.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>364 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Job and career families are particularly appropriate for knowledge workers because they
spell out the career ladders that apply specifically to the different categories employed in an
organization.
<p>Rewarding knowledge workers: six tips
Adopt total reward policies emphasizing scope for achievement, recognition &bull;
and growth.
<p>Consider segmenting the reward package for specified groups of knowledge &bull;
workers.
<p>Introduce competency-based pay. &bull;
<p>Create a career-family structure with levels defined in competency terms. &bull;
<p>Define career ladders and the rewards associated with career progression. &bull;
<p>Develop a work environment that ensures that knowledge workers have the &bull;
resources they need, the scope to use and develop their knowledge and skills
and the recognition they deserve.

<p>Introduction
<p>Manual worker pay systems that have not been &lsquo;harmonized&rsquo; &ndash; that is, brought into line with
the reward system for staff &ndash; frequently differ from the systems described elsewhere in this
book in three ways. First, the use of a time-rate basis of payment, second the use of spot rates,
and third the use of individual payment-by-results schemes.
<p>Factors affecting the pay of manual workers
<p>The three main factors affecting the pay of manual workers are: first, bargaining arrange-
ments; second, local labour market pressures; and third, trends in the use of technology on the
shopfloor.
<p>Bargaining arrangements
<p>The pay of manual workers is often influenced strongly by national and local agreements with
trade unions, which will determine rates for particular jobs or skill levels. This constitutes an
aspect of the effort bargain. The objectives of workers and their trade union officials and rep-
resentatives is to strike a bargain with management about what they consider to be a reason-
able amount of pay that should be provided by their employer in return for their contribution.
It is, in effect, an agreement between workers and management &ndash; the pay/work bargain &ndash; that
lays down the amount of work to be done for an agreed wage, not just the hours to be worked.
Explicitly or implicitly, all employers are in a bargaining situation with regard to payment
systems. This applies whether or not workers are unionized. Negotiated wage settlements can
also affect non-unionized companies.
<p>Local labour market pressures
<p>Manual workers are usually recruited from the local labour market, where the laws of supply
and demand can have a marked effect on the rates of pay for particular occupations if there is
a skills shortage or surplus, or reluctance on the part of workers to carry out certain jobs. The
local labour market is a fairly perfect market in one of the senses used by economists, namely
that there is widespread and easily available knowledge of rates of pay (the price of labour) and
there may also exist, although not for every occupation, a fair degree of choice by both buyers
and sellers of where they obtain labour or where they provide it.</p>

<p>Technology
<p>The increased use of technology on the shopfloor, for example, in the form of computer-aided
manufacture, has meant that the demand for a number of the traditional skills has diminished
while the demand for new ones has increased. Computer-controlled machines are more likely
to be operated by technicians than by members of the old skilled trades. This is one of the
factors that has led to pressures to harmonize shopfloor and office or laboratory payment
systems.
<p>Time rates
<p>Time rates, also known as day rates, day work, flat rates or hourly rates, provide workers with
a predetermined rate for the actual hours they work. The rate is fixed by formal or informal
negotiations, on the basis of local rates or, less often, by reference to a hierarchy produced by
job evaluation. The rate only varies with time, never with performance or output. However,
additional payments are made on top of base rates for overtime, shift working, night work, call
outs, adverse working conditions and, sometimes, location.
<p>The situation where time rates are most commonly used is where it is thought impossible or
undesirable to use a payment-by-results system, for example in maintenance work. From the
viewpoint of employees, the advantage of time rates is that their earnings are predictable and
steady and they do not have to engage in endless arguments with rate fixers and supervisors
about piece rate or time allowances. The argument against them is that they do not provide a
direct incentive relating the reward to the effort or the results. Two ways of modifying the
basic time-rate approach are to adopt high day rates as described below or measured day work
as covered later in this chapter.
<p>Time rates may take the form of what are often called high day rates. These are higher than the
minimum time rate and may contain a consolidated bonus rate element. The underlying
assumption is that higher base rates will encourage greater effort without the problems created
when operating an incentive scheme. This is in line with the theory of the economy of high
wages mentioned in Chapter 15. High day rates are usually above the local market rates to
attract and retain high-quality workers.
<p>Pay structures
<p>Pay systems for manual workers are seldom graded in the ways described in Chapter 19 unless
their conditions have been harmonized (see later in this chapter). Time rates are usually paid
in the form of spot rates: that is, a fixed rate for a job or an individual. However, spot rates may
be designated for different levels of skill. Traditionally, a person-based pay system was adopted </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>368 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>with three basic rates of pay attached to people &ndash; unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled &ndash; above
which there might be special rates for highly skilled occupations such as toolmakers. Earnings
from payment-by-result schemes were added to these rates. Another arrangement is to have a
more discerning hierarchy of rates linked to skill levels: a form of skill-based pay. Yet another
arrangement is to have a job-based pay system with different rates for different jobs; in a dis-
tribution centre for example: picker, packer and forklift-truck driver.
<p>Incentive schemes for manual workers
<p>Incentive schemes for manual workers consist of:
<p>Payment-by&ndash;results (PBR) schemes, which pay for output and include piecework, &bull;
work-measured schemes and measured day work. Payments are added to base rate
although, rarely, payment is entirely related to output.
<p>Contingent pay schemes, which relate pay to performance or skill (performance-related &bull;
pay and skill-based pay). Increases may be consolidated or paid as lump sum bonuses.
<p>Collective schemes, which pay bonuses related to either team or plant performance. &bull;
<p>Each of these methods is described below. First, however, it is necessary to deal with the con-
siderations affecting the use of incentive schemes.
<p>Considerations affecting the use of incentive schemes
<p>The considerations to be taken into account in developing and maintaining incentive schemes
are the criteria of effectiveness and their advantages and disadvantages.
<p>Criteria of effectiveness
<p>Incentive schemes aim to motivate employees to exert greater effort. They will do so effectively
only if:
<p>The link between effort and reward is obvious and easily understood, ie there is a clear &bull;
line-of-sight.
<p>The value of the reward is worthwhile in relation to the effort. &bull;
<p>Individuals are able to influence their level of effort or behaviour in order to earn a &bull;
reward.
<p>Rewards closely follow the effort. &bull;
<p>The integrity of the scheme is preserved &ndash; it is not allowed to degenerate and cannot be &bull;
manipulated so that individuals are over-rewarded.</p>
<br>

<p>Rewarding Manual Workers 369
<p>The rationale for incentive schemes
<p>The basic rationale of incentive schemes is the simple proposition that people are motivated
by money. It is believed that they will work harder if rewards are tied directly to the results they
achieve. This is essentially &lsquo;Taylorism&rsquo; &ndash; FW Taylor&rsquo;s concept of scientific management,
meaning the use of systematic observation and measurement, task specialism and, in effect,
the reduction of workers to the level of efficiently functioning machines who will only work
harder if they are paid more.
<p>Certainly, the experience of most people who have installed a PBR scheme in a workplace
where it did not previously exist is that productivity increases substantially when the scheme
is new, although the level of increase is not always maintained. Studies in the United States by
Binder (1990), Guzzo, Jette and Katsell (1985), Lawler (1971) and Nalbantian (1987) have
shown productivity increases of between 15 per cent and 35 per cent when incentive schemes
have been put into place.
<p>Incentive schemes are used in the belief that they yield increased output, lower the cost of pro-
duction and provide higher earnings for the workers concerned. It is also commonly believed
that less supervision is needed to keep output up. Indeed, when direct supervision is difficult,
PBR is often advocated as the only practicable form of payment.
<p>Disadvantages of incentive schemes
<p>The argument that people work harder only when they are paid more is regarded by some
people as overwhelming. They do not accept the proposition that intrinsic and non-financial
motivators can have an equally, if not more, powerful and longer-lasting impact.
<p>The disadvantages of shopfloor incentive schemes are that they can:
<p>Be unfair: earnings may fluctuate through no fault of the individual because of lack of &bull;
work, shortage of materials, design modifications or the need to learn new skills. It may
also be felt that the method of altering rates is unfair.
<p>Be ineffective: workers may have their own ideas about how much they want to earn or &bull;
how hard they want to work, and regulate their output accordingly.
<p>Penalize skill: the more skilled workers may be given the more difficult and often less &bull;
remunerative jobs.
<p>Cause wage drift: the difficulty of conforming to criteria such as clearly relating pay to &bull;
effort and the lax approach of some organizations to the management of incentive
schemes contribute to increases in earnings at a higher rate than productivity. Degen-
eration and wage drift are a particular problem with work-measured schemes as dis-
cussed later in this chapter.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>370 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Lead to management escaping its responsibilities: team leaders and supervisors may &bull;
rely on the incentive scheme to control output. Instead of taking poor performers to
one side and informing them that their work is not up to standard, they are tempted to
take the soft option and simply point to the figures.
<p>Be costly to maintain: extra work-study engineers, rate fixers and inspectors are often &bull;
needed to maintain the scheme and exercise quality control.
<p>Produce strife in the workplace: arguments about rates and accusations of unjustified &bull;
rate-cutting are common in workshops where incentive schemes are used.
<p>Create reluctance to exert the expected level of effort: workers may believe that man- &bull;
agement will progressively increase the performance targets required to trigger the
same bonus payment. They may therefore be reluctant to carry on at the incentivized
level of performance they have achieved, on the grounds that this will only result in
higher targets that will make the bonus more difficult to obtain.
<p>Result in poor-quality work: concentration on output can lead to neglect of quality. &bull;
<p>Lead to poor teamwork: individual incentive schemes by definition encourage indi- &bull;
vidual rather than team effort.
<p>Result in accidents and health hazards: workers may be tempted to cut corners and &bull;
ignore safety precautions to achieve output targets; repetitive strain injury (RSI) may
result if they work too hard on tasks requiring repeated small movements.
<p>These are powerful arguments but shopfloor incentive schemes persist. The number of workers
paid on this basis may have diminished, but this is because of structural (the reduction in
manufacturing) and technological reasons rather than because managements have turned
against it.
<p>Payment by results schemes
Piecework
<p>Piecework is the oldest and simplest form of incentive scheme for manual workers. Operators
are paid at a specific rate according to their output or the number of &lsquo;pieces&rsquo; they produce. Pay
is directly proportional to output, although most piecework schemes provide a fallback rate at
minimum earnings level. The proportion of the minimum rate to average earnings varies. It is
typically set at 70 or 80 per cent, although it can be as low as 30 per cent.</p>

<p>Rewarding Manual Workers 371
<p>Work-measured schemes
<p>Work-measured schemes are the most popular form of incentive plan for shopfloor workers.
They use work-measurement techniques to determine standard output levels over a period or
standard times for tasks. The incentive pay is then linked with the output achieved relative to
the standard, or to the time saved in performing each task.
<p>The form of work measurement used is time study. Jobs are broken down into their constitu-
ent parts or tasks and the time taken by workers to complete each part is measured with a stop-
watch by a work-study or industrial engineer. A number of measurements will be made of the
time taken by different workers on the same task or the same worker carrying out the task at
different times of the day and night. Time study is based on objective measurements, but
account has to be taken of the fact that there will probably be significant differences between
the rates at which operators work &ndash; the effort they put into the job. Work-study engineers have
therefore to assess what that rate is, a process known as effort rating.
<p>Individual effort is rated in terms of &lsquo;standard performance&rsquo;. This is the performance that a
qualified and motivated worker should be able to achieve without over-exertion. The effort
needed to achieve standard performance is sometimes represented as equivalent to walking at
four miles an hour (ie quite briskly). All the operators studied are given an effort rating relative
to this standard. The raw times observed in the work study are then adjusted by the work-
study engineer to produce a basic time that represents a rating of 100 to indicate the perform-
ance of an average operator working conscientiously without financial motivation. This
involves a large element of subjectivity, although experienced and well-trained engineers
should be capable of making reasonably accurate and consistent assessments.
<p>The basic time will be further adjusted to incorporate allowances for relaxation, personal
needs, fatigue and any time regularly taken up by other aspects of the work such as cleaning or
resetting machines. The result is the standard time for the task, usually expressed as &lsquo;standard
minutes&rsquo;.
<p>Work-measured schemes can use performance ratings that are calculated by a formula as in
the following example:
<p>Number of units produced per day (132) &times; standard minutes per unit (4)
Actual time taken in minutes per day (48)
<p>528
480
<p>&times; 100 = 110%=
<p>In the most common proportionate system of payment, the performance rating is applied
directly to the base rate, so that in the above example the incentive payment would be an addi-
tional 10 per cent.
<p>The problem with time study is that, although it is based on objective measurements, the
standard time that is ultimately obtained is the product of a number of additional subjective
judgements. Employees who are being timed may deliberately restrict their performance in
order to achieve low standard times and therefore higher bonuses with less effort. It is up to </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>372 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>the work-study engineer&rsquo;s skill and judgement to detect such restrictions, and this can lead to
arguments and even strife. In organizations with trade unions it is common practice to train
some representatives in work-measurement techniques to promote the achievement of accept-
able judgements on standard times.
<p>Alternatively, PBR payments can be based on the time-saved principle. The amount of the
bonus depends on the difference between the actual time taken to perform the task and the
standard time allowed. If a task is done in less than the standard time, then the percentage of
time saved is applied to the base rate to calculate the bonus. The standard times may be deter-
mined by work measurement, although traditionally &lsquo;rate fixers&rsquo; were employed to make more
subjective and therefore often more controversial judgements.
<p>Measured day work
<p>Measured day work schemes were originally developed for large batch or mass-production
factories in the 1950s and 1960s, when it became evident that, despite all efforts, it was impos-
sible to control wage drift. They are, however, much less common now. Manufacturing firms
often prefer to pay a high day rate.
<p>When they exist, measured day work schemes provide for the pay of employees to be fixed on
the understanding that they will maintain a specified level of performance, but in the short
term pay does not fluctuate with their performance. The arrangement depends on work meas-
urement to define the required level of performance and to monitor the actual level. The fun-
damental principles of measured day work are that there is an incentive level of performance
and that the incentive payment is guaranteed in advance, putting employees under the obliga-
tion to perform at the effort level required. In contrast, a conventional work-measured incen-
tive scheme allows employees discretion as to their effort level but relates their pay directly to
the results they achieve. Between these two extremes there are a variety of alternatives, includ-
ing banded incentives, stepped schemes and various forms of high day rate.
<p>Contingent pay schemes
Performance-related pay
<p>Performance-related pay systems such as those described in Chapter 10 can be used for manual
workers. Employees receive a high base rate and an additional performance-related payment,
which is either a lump sum bonus or consolidated into basic pay. The award is governed by
assessments of skill and performance ratings under headings such as quality, flexibility, con-
tribution to teamworking and ability to hit targets. The percentage award is usually small &ndash; up
to 5 per cent.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Manual Workers 373
<p>Performance-related pay is sometimes introduced for manual workers as part of a programme
for harmonizing their conditions of employment with those of salaried staff. It can be appro-
priate in circumstances where work measurement is difficult or impossible to use, in high-
technology manufacturing where operations are computer-controlled or automated and
teamwork and multiskilling are important, in organizations where the emphasis is on quality,
and in those where just-in-time systems are used. But it is difficult to operate and trade unions
tend to be hostile, and it is therefore uncommon.
<p>Skill-based pay
<p>Skill-based pay, as described in detail in Chapter 10, rewards people with extra pay for acquir-
ing and using additional skills. It can be paid as a supplement to a base rate or it can result in
workers being placed on a higher spot rate.
<p>Collective schemes
Group or team incentive schemes
<p>Group or team incentive schemes provide for the payment of a bonus to members of a group
or team related to the output achieved by the group in relation to defined targets or to work-
measured standards.
<p>Factory or plant-wide schemes
<p>Factory or plant-wide schemes pay a bonus to individuals that is related to the performance of
the factory as a whole, which may be measured in terms of added value as in a gain-sharing
scheme (see Chapter 13) or some other index of productivity (eg units produced, cost per unit
of output). The bonus may be added to individual incentive payments.
<p>Assessment of schemes
<p>Table 23.1 contains an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of each type of scheme
from the viewpoint of employers and employees and a review of the circumstances when the
scheme is more likely to be appropriate.</p>

<p>Rewarding Manual Workers 377
<p>Single status and harmonization
<p>Single status means that manual or shopfloor workers on wages are on salaried terms and con-
ditions and are entitled to the same conditions of employment, such as sick pay, as other
members of staff. Harmonization means the reduction of differences in the pay structure and
other employment conditions between categories of employee, usually manual and staff
employees. It involves the adoption of a common approach and criteria to pay and benefits for
all employees.
<p>The pressure for harmonization has occurred because of the belief that status differentials
between people in the same employment cannot be justified. Harmonization facilitates the
more flexible use of labour, and the impact of technology has enhanced the skills of shopfloor
workers and made differential treatment harder to defend. Equal pay legislation has been a
major challenge to differentiation between staff and manual workers.
<p>ACAS (1982) suggested that organizations, before pursuing a programme of harmonization,
should seek answers to the following questions:
<p>What differences in the treatment of groups of employees are a rational result of differ- &bull;
ences in the work or the job requirements?
<p>Is it possible to estimate the direct costs of removing these differences? &bull;
<p>What differences in status are explicitly recognized as part of the &lsquo;reward package&rsquo; for &bull;
different groups in the labour force?
<p>What would be the possible repercussive effects of harmonization? &bull;
<p>How do the existing differences affect industrial relations in the organization? &bull;
<p>Rewarding manual workers: six tips
Consider scope for single status or harmonization. &bull;
<p>Ensure that rates of pay for jobs and people are linked to the level of skill or the &bull;
degree of multiskilling required.
<p>If planning to introduce new payment-by-results schemes or amend existing &bull;
ones, involve employees and their representatives in discussions on what needs
to be done and reach agreement on how the changes should be introduced.
<p>Consider introducing team pay or gain-sharing. &bull;
<p>Ensure that payment-by-results schemes are based on work measurement and &bull;
provide a clear line of sight between effort and reward.
<p>Review all existing payment-by-results schemes to ensure that they are &bull;
functioning properly and are not encouraging wage drift.</p>

<p>Introduction
<p>Employee benefits consist of arrangements made by employers for their employees that
enhance the latter&rsquo;s well-being. They are provided in addition to pay and form important
parts of the total reward package. As part of total remuneration, they may be deferred or
contingent, like a pension scheme (see Chapter 26), insurance cover or sick pay, or they may

<p>382 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>be immediate, like a company car or a loan. Employee benefits also include holidays and
leave arrangements, which are not strictly remuneration. Benefits are sometimes referred to
dismissively as &lsquo;perks&rsquo; (perquisites) or &lsquo;fringe benefits&rsquo;, but when they cater for personal
security or personal needs they could hardly be described as &lsquo;fringe&rsquo;.
<p>Employee benefits are a costly part of the remuneration package. They can amount to a third
or more of basic pay costs and therefore have to be planned and managed with care.
<p>Note that many benefits such as company cars, interest-free loans, private medical insurance,
and prizes, gifts and vouchers can be taxed quite heavily. It is worth seeking advice from a tax
specialist if in any doubt.
<p>Rationale for employee benefits
<p>Employee benefits provide for the personal needs of employees and they are a means of increas-
ing their commitment to the organization and demonstrating that their employers care for
their well-being. Not all employers care but, like the ones that do, they still provide benefits to
ensure that the total remuneration package is competitive. And some benefits, such as mater-
nity leave, have to be provided by law in the UK.
<p>Employee benefit strategies and policies
<p>Employee benefit strategies will be concerned in general terms with the direction the organiza-
tion wants to go with regard to the range and scale of benefits it wants to provide and the costs
it is prepared to incur. The strategy forms the foundation for the formulation of employee
benefit policies.
<p>Employee benefit policies are concerned with:
<p>the types of benefits to be provided, taking into account their value to employees, their &bull;
cost and the need to make the benefit package competitive;
<p>the size of the benefits; &bull;
<p>the need to harmonize benefits; &bull;
<p>the total costs of benefits provision in relation to the costs of basic pay; &bull;
<p>the use of flexible benefits, as described in Chapter 25. &bull;</p>

<p>Employee Benefits 383
<p>Types of benefit
<p>The main benefits deal with personal security, financial assistance, personal needs, holidays,
company cars, other benefits, voluntary benefits and concierge services as described below.
<p>Personal security
<p>Personal security benefits include:
<p>Health care: the provision through medical insurance of private health care to cover &bull;
the cost of private hospital treatment (permanent health insurance), making periodic
health screening available and, sometimes, dental insurance.
<p>Insurance cover: for death in service (if not already provided in a pension scheme), &bull;
personal accident and business travel.
<p>Sick pay: providing full pay for a given period of sickness and a proportion of pay (typ- &bull;
ically half-pay for a further period). Sick pay entitlement is usually service-related. Sick
pay can be costly unless attendance management and control practices are intro-
duced.
<p>Redundancy pay: additions can be made to the statutory redundancy pay, including &bull;
extra notice compensation, extra service-related payments (eg one month per year of
service) and ex gratia payments to directors and executives in compensation for loss of
office (sometimes called golden handshakes).
<p>Career counselling (outplacement advice) can be provided by specialist consultants to &bull;
employees who have been made redundant.
<p>Financial assistance
<p>Financial assistance can take the following forms:
<p>Company loans: interest-free modest loans, or low interest on more substantial loans, &bull;
which are usually earmarked for specific purposes such as home improvements.
<p>Season ticket loans: interest-free loans for annual season tickets. &bull;
<p>Mortgage assistance: subsidized interest payments on mortgages up to a given price &bull;
threshold. This benefit is most likely to be provided by financial services companies.
<p>Relocation packages: for staff who are being relocated by the organization or recruited &bull;
from elsewhere, the costs of removal and legal/estate agents&rsquo; fees may be refunded.
<p>Fees to professional bodies: eg the CIPD. &bull;</p>
<br>

<p>384 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>Personal needs
<p>Employee benefits satisfying personal needs include:
<p>maternity and paternity leave and pay above the statutory minimum; &bull;
<p>leave for personal reasons; &bull;
<p>childcare through workplace nurseries or vouchers; &bull;
<p>pre-retirement counselling; &bull;
<p>personal counselling through employee assistance programmes; &bull;
<p>sports and social facilities; &bull;
<p>company discounts, whereby employees can buy the products or services offered by the &bull;
company at a reduced price;
<p>retail vouchers to buy goods at chain stores. &bull;
<p>Holidays
<p>Before the European Working Time Directive in 1998, there was no statutory obligation to
offer any paid holiday except for the standard &lsquo;bank&rsquo; holidays. Employers are now obliged to
offer a minimum of 20 days&rsquo; paid holiday per year, including bank holidays.
<p>In practice, most organizations have always offered annual leave well in excess of this minimum,
with few UK companies giving less than four weeks to employees at any level. Basic holiday
entitlements are typically five weeks plus bank holidays, with some organizations offering up
to six weeks for senior executives (who in practice may rarely have time to take full advantage
of the provision) or on a service-related basis to more junior staff. The entitlement for holiday
begins to accrue on the first day at work.
<p>Organizations are obliged by statute to provide paid maternal and paternal leave and unpaid
family leave.
<p>Company cars
<p>Although the tax liability for individuals with company &lsquo;status&rsquo; cars has increased steadily over
the last decade, they still remain one of the most valued perks, perhaps because people do not
have to make a capital outlay, do not lose money through depreciation and are spared the
worry and expense of maintenance.
<p>Other benefits
<p>Other benefits include free car parking, Christmas parties and tea/coffee/cold drinks.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Employee Benefits 385
<p>Voluntary (&lsquo;affinity&rsquo;) benefits
<p>Voluntary benefit schemes provide opportunities for employees to buy goods or services at
discounted prices. The employers negotiate deals with the providers but the scheme does not
cost them anything.
<p>Popular voluntary benefits include:
<p>Health: private medical insurance, dental insurance, health screening. &bull;
<p>Protection: critical illness insurance, life insurance, income protection insurance, per- &bull;
sonal accident insurance.
<p>Leisure: holidays, days out, travel insurance, computer leasing, bicycle leasing, pet &bull;
insurance, gym membership.
<p>Home: household goods, online shopping. &bull;
<p>Concierge services
<p>Concierge services can include dealing with home and car repair and maintenance, financial
services, buying presents, restaurant reservations, theatre tickets and travel arrangements.
They originated in the United States in response to the long-hours culture that limited per-
sonal time away from the workplace. Businesses benefit from providing these services because
they enable staff to concentrate on their jobs by freeing them from mundane personal tasks
such as waiting at home for deliveries or getting their cars serviced.
<p>At PricewaterhouseCoopers staff can pay a fixed sum a month for requests. These can be for
anything from shopping, theatre tickets, travel arrangements or arranging a plumber, to event
planning &ndash; &lsquo;so long as it&rsquo;s legal&rsquo;.
<p>Incidence of benefits
<p>The proportion of respondents to the 2009 CIPD reward management survey providing six
key benefits were:
<p>25 days paid leave: 67 per cent. &bull;
<p>Free car parking: 60 per cent. &bull;
<p>Childcare vouchers: 56 per cent. &bull;
<p>Life insurance: 51 per cent. &bull;
<p>Enhanced maternity/paternity leave: 43 per cent. &bull;
<p>An employee assistance programme: 42 per cent. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>386 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>Choice of benefits
<p>Some benefits, such as holidays, maternity leave and redundancy pay, have to be provided by
statute &ndash; there is no choice except on the extent to which statutory provisions may by enhanced.
Neither, for a responsible employer, is there any real choice over the provision of pensions, life
insurance or sick pay. Company cars for executives are still popular in spite of the tax penalties
because of the felt need to be competitive.
<p>Some optional benefits such as health insurance, childcare and low-interest loans may be
selected because they will be appreciated and because they help to make the reward package
competitive.
<p>The factors affecting the choice of or provision or scale will be:
<p>what employees want, as established by opinion surveys; &bull;
<p>what other employers are providing, as established by market surveys; &bull;
<p>what the organization can afford. &bull;
<p>Flexible benefit schemes give employees a choice within limits of the type or scale of benefits
offered to them by their employers.
<p>Administering employee benefits
<p>Employee benefits can be expensive and it is necessary to monitor the costs of providing them
and the extent to which a cost&ndash;benefit comparison justifies continuing with them on the
present scale or at all. There should be a budget for employee benefit costs and expenditure
should be monitored against it. Regular surveys should be undertaken of the attitude of
employees to the benefits package. They may suggest where benefit expenditure could be redi-
rected to areas where it would be more appreciated. They may also suggest that there is a need
to adopt a flexible benefit policy, as described in the next chapter.
<p>Total reward statements
<p>Total reward statements communicate to employees the value of the employee benefits such
as pensions, holidays, company cars, free car parking and subsidized meals they receive in
addition to their pay. They also describe any other rewards they get, such as learning and
development opportunities. The aim is to ensure that they appreciate the total value of their
reward package. Too often, people are unaware of what they obtain in addition to their pay.
Table 24.1 shows how a total reward statement can be set out.</p>

<p>How to introduce flexible benefits &bull;
<p>Introduction
<p>Flexible benefit schemes give employees a choice within limits of the type or scale of benefits
offered to them by their employers. A wide variety of approaches is available.
<p>Interest in such schemes has been generated because employee benefits are not all equally
wanted or appreciated by the staff that receive them and, from the employer&rsquo;s point of view,
some benefits will not therefore provide value for money. However, the number that have
introduced formal flexible schemes is relatively small &ndash; only 13 per cent of the respondents to
the CIPD 2008 Reward Management Survey had them. In this chapter the reasons for intro-
ducing flexible benefits are set out, the different types of flexible benefit schemes are defined
and the steps required to introduce a scheme are explained.
<p>Reasons for introducing flexible benefits
<p>Flexible benefit schemes may be introduced in order to:
<p>388 </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Flexible Benefits 389
<p>meet the diverse needs of employees and increase the perceived value of the package to &bull;
them &ndash; enabling them, to a degree, to decide for themselves what benefits they want
and the size of particular benefits to suit their own life style rather than being forced to
accept what their employers think is good for them;
<p>enable employers to get better value for money from their benefits expenditure because &bull;
it meets the needs and wants of employees;
<p>control costs by providing employees with a fund to spend rather than promising a &bull;
particular level of benefits;
<p>aid recruitment and retention &ndash; as flexible benefits are generally preferred by employ- &bull;
ees to fixed benefits of equivalent value;
<p>help to harmonize terms and conditions in a merger. &bull;
<p>Types of flexible benefits schemes
<p>The main types of schemes are described below.
<p>Flex individual benefits
<p>Employees are given the opportunity to vary the size of individual benefits, paying extra if they
want more or, in effect, being paid cash if they want less. A typical example is a flexible car
scheme that enables people to pay more for a better model or, if they decide to downsize,
receive the reduction in cost to the company in cash. Choices are made on recruitment or
when the car is replaced.
<p>Another common arrangement is to provide scope, within limits, to buy or sell holiday time
over the holiday year; for example, so many extra days could be &lsquo;bought&rsquo; at the daily rate of the
employee or so many could be &lsquo;sold&rsquo; and the amount at the daily rate added to pay.
<p>This is a simple approach that is easy to introduce and administer and is therefore the most
common method of flexing benefits. The disadvantage is that the impact may be limited.
<p>Flex existing entitlement
<p>Employees may choose to increase, decrease or end their current benefits and select new ben-
efits from the menu provided. The value of the benefits bought and sold is then aggregated and
the net amount added to or deducted from pay. An example of how this might look for an
employee whose salary is &pound;30,000 per annum is shown in Table 25.1.</p>
<br>

<p>Dental insurance Nil Nil Nil
<p>Childcare vouchers Nil &pound;200 per month (&pound;200)
<p>Total monthly
adjustment
<p>(&pound;150)
<p>This arrangement can be simplified by making only two or three benefits flexible. The
rules often stipulate that such essential core benefits as pensions and life insurance cannot
be reduced, and limits may be placed on the scope for flexing other benefits, for example
holidays.
<p>Flex fund
<p>Employees are allocated a fund of money to &lsquo;spend&rsquo; on benefits from a menu. This is therefore
sometimes described as the &lsquo;cafeteria&rsquo; approach. Certain &lsquo;core&rsquo; compulsory benefits such as
pensions and life insurance have to be maintained. The value of the flex fund is big enough to
enable individual employees to &lsquo;buy&rsquo; their existing benefits and thus retain them without addi-
tional cost.
<p>A simplified example of a flex fund benefits-choice menu for someone with a salary of &pound;30,000
with a flex fund of &pound;12,000 is shown in Table 25.2.
<p>The impact of the choices made is shown in Table 25.3.
<p>Any overspend would be funded by salary sacrifice. In this example, where less than &pound;12,000
has been spent, the unspent flex fund would be paid as a monthly, non-consolidated cash
sum.</p>

<p>392 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>Introducing flexible benefits
<p>The steps required to introduce flexible benefits are described below:
<p>1. Define business need: the benefits in terms of meeting the diverse needs of employees,
helping recruitment and retention and getting better value for money from expenditure
on employee benefits.
<p>2. Seek views: conduct an opinion survey of employees on what they think of present
benefit arrangements, what they think about flexible benefits and what benefits they
would like to be eligible for flex (this could be accompanied by information about how
flexible benefits might work, and would therefore be the first shot in a communications
campaign &ndash; communicating about flexible benefits is important).
<p>3. Decide objectives and essential elements: the objectives of the scheme should be deter-
mined and its essential elements defined. This will include broadly the extent to which it
is believed that the approach should be to go for a full scheme based either on flexing
existing benefits or a flex fund, or whether the approach should be to flex individual ben-
efits. There may be something to be said for starting with the latter, simpler approach
(which will be cheaper to install) with the possibility of extending it at a later stage when
experience has shown that it is working well. The strategy should also explore the need for
outside advice and, on the basis of initial discussions with potential advisors, how much
would need to be spent on developing and maintaining the scheme. One of the common
objections to flexible benefits is the costs involved, especially when the proposed scheme
is a fairly complex one and outside professional advice and support is required. Prelimi-
nary decisions need to be made at this stage on the likelihood that such advice will be
required so that the costs involved can be estimated. It is also necessary to decide on the
need for a project team with employee involvement.
<p>4. Set up project team: this could be a joint management/employee team (involvement is
very desirable) with the responsibility of planning and overseeing the development pro-
gramme.
<p>5. Decide who is going to carry out the development work: someone from within the organ-
ization should be in charge of the project, with help as required and available from flexible
benefit, finance, tax and pensions specialists. The development of a scheme requires con-
siderable expertise in these areas in developing and costing schemes, exploring tax consid-
erations and setting up the administration.
<p>6. Design scheme: this involves deciding on core benefits, which will have to be maintained,
identifying benefits that can be flexed and any limits on the extent to which these benefits
can be flexed, costing the benefits as necessary to enable menus to be produced and flex
funds set up, if appropriate, and considering how the scheme should be administered.
Simple schemes can be administered on paper but there is software available to administer </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Flexible Benefits 393
<p>more elaborate ones. An intranet can be used to help with administration &ndash; employees can
make their choice of benefits from the screen and calculate the financial implications.
<p>7. Communicate details of the scheme: employees need to be given detailed but easily under-
stood information about the proposed scheme &ndash; how it will work, how it will affect them,
its advantages, and how and when it will be introduced.
<p>8. Pilot test: there is much to be said for piloting the scheme in a part of the organization to
test reactions and administrative arrangements.
<p>9. Introduce scheme: the earlier communications need to be reinforced generally at this
stage and arrangements must be made to provide individual employees with advice
through personal contact, a help line or a help screen on the intranet.
<p>10. Evaluate scheme: monitor and measure impact.

<p>Introduction
<p>Pensions provide an income to employees when they retire and to their surviving dependants
on the death of the employee, and deferred benefits to employees who leave. Occupational
schemes offered by organizations, as distinct from state pensions, are funded by contributions
from the organization and usually, but not always, the employee. Occupational pensions are

<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Pension Schemes 395
<p>the most significant employee benefit and are a valuable part of the total reward package. But
they are perhaps the most complex part.
<p>The so-called &lsquo;pensions crisis&rsquo; has arisen because many occupational schemes are underfunded
and suffering the strain of having to cope with more pensioners who are living longer. But to
put it in perspective it should be remembered that a huge amount of money in the UK (&pound;1,300
billion) is invested in pension funds, more than in the rest of the EU put together.
<p>The aim of this chapter is to present an outline of why pensions are provided, what they
provide and the main types of schemes. The reasons for the shift in occupational schemes
from defined benefits (final salary) schemes to defined contribution (money purchase schemes)
are discussed, and the chapter continues with a summary of the law relating to providing pen-
sions advice and a discussion of approaches to communicating about pensions.
<p>Why occupational pensions are provided
<p>Pensions are provided because they demonstrate that the organization is a good employer
concerned about the long-term interests of its employees who want the security provided by a
reasonable pension when they retire. Good pension schemes help to attract and retain high-
quality people by maintaining competitive levels of total remuneration.
<p>What occupational pension schemes provide
<p>The range and level of benefits from pension schemes depend on the type of scheme and the
level of contributions. In general, schemes provide:
<p>Benefits on retirement: these are related to the final salary of individuals when they &bull;
retire or the amount that has been paid into a defined contribution scheme while the
individuals were members.
<p>Benefits on death: the pensions of widows or widowers and children are normally &bull;
related to the member&rsquo;s anticipated pension; the most common fraction is half.
<p>Benefits on leaving an employer: individuals leaving an employer can elect to take one &bull;
of the following options: a deferred pension from the occupational scheme they are
leaving, the transfer of the pension entitlement from the present employer to the new
employer (though this is not always possible), or a refund of their contributions (but
only if they have completed less than two years&rsquo; membership of the pension scheme).</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>396 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>The two main types of occupational schemes
<p>The two main types of occupational schemes are described below. Other types are covered in
the next section.
<p>Defined benefit (final salary) schemes
<p>The main features of a defined benefit scheme are outlined below.
<p>Pension entitlement on retirement
<p>On retiring the employee is entitled to a pension that is calculated as a fraction of their &bull;
final salary (on retirement or an average of the last two or three years) multiplied by the
length of pensionable service.
<p>The maximum proportion of salary allowed by the Inland Revenue is two-thirds of &bull;
final salary after 40 years service.
<p>The amount of the pension depends on the final salary, the value of the annuity that &bull;
provides the pension and the accrual rate. The accrual rate refers to the fraction of final
salary that can be earned per year of service. When a pension is described as 1/60th it
means that 40 years service would produce a two-thirds of final salary pension, and 30
years would produce a pension of half the final salary. This is a fairly typical fraction in
private sector firms.
<p>Employer and employee contributions
<p>Employer contributions can be a fixed percentage of salary. Alternatively the percent- &bull;
age increases with service or is a multiple of the employee&rsquo;s contribution (eg the
employer contributes 15 per cent if the employee contributes 5 per cent). The level of
employer contribution is typically around 16 per cent.
<p>Employee contribution rates vary considerably, ranging from 3 per cent to 15 per cent &bull;
with a median of around 8 per cent.
<p>Pension fund
<p>Employee and employer contributions are paid into a combined fund and there is no &bull;
direct link between fund size and the pensions paid.
<p>The money remaining in the fund after any lump sums have been taken out is invested &bull;
in an annuity to provide a regular income, the amount of which may be revised upwards
periodically to compensate for inflation.</p>

<p>Pension Schemes 397
<p>Dependants
<p>Dependants are entitled to a percentage of the employee&rsquo;s pension entitlement if he or she dies
during retirement or in service with the company.
<p>Lump sum
<p>Part of the pension may be exchanged for a tax-free lump sum, up to a maximum under
Inland Revenue rules of 1/80th per year for up to 40 years service.
<p>Defined contribution (money purchase) schemes
<p>The main features of a defined contribution scheme are discussed below.
<p>Pension entitlement
<p>The employee receives a pension on retirement that is related to the size of the fund accumu-
lated by the combined contributions of the employee and employer. The amount of the
pension depends on the size of contributions, the rate of return on the investment of the accu-
mulated fund and the rate of return on an annuity purchased by the employer. It is not related
to the employee&rsquo;s final salary.
<p>Contributions
<p>The employer contributes a defined percentage of earnings, which may be fixed, age-related or
linked to what the employee pays. The level of employer contribution is typically around 6 per
cent. The employee also contributes a fixed percentage of salary.
<p>Pension fund
<p>The contributions are invested and the money used at retirement to purchase a regular income,
usually via an annuity contract from an insurance company. The retirement pension is there-
fore whatever annual payment can be purchased with the money accumulated in the fund for
a member.
<p>Members have individual shares of the fund, which represent their personal entitlements and
which will directly determine the pensions they receive.
<p>Dependants
<p>Dependants receive death in service and death in retirement pensions.</p>

<p>398 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>Lump sum
<p>One-quarter of the pension can be taken as a tax-free lump sum on retirement.
<p>Comparison of defined benefits and defined contribution schemes
<p>The main differences are that a defined benefits (final salary) scheme provides a guaranteed
pension to the employee but the employer is unable to predict the costs, which can fluctuate
unfavourably. Conversely, a defined contribution (money purchase) scheme provides an
uncertain pension and the cost to the employer is predictable. The differences are summarized
in Table 26.1.
<p>Defined benefit or defined contribution?
Defined benefit scheme costs and risks
<p>Defined benefit schemes are more costly to employers (16 per cent average contribution)
than defined contribution schemes (6 per cent average contribution). They are also more
risky for employers because the pension is based on a guaranteed formula and the cost of
providing this guaranteed benefit may be higher than expected. Typically, employee contri-
butions are fixed and those of the employer vary on the basis of specialist advice from the
scheme actuary. Hence, the risk of higher than expected costs falls on the employer. Costs

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Pension Schemes 399
<p>might exceed expectations for a number of reasons, for example pensioners are living longer
(an important factor in putting up costs), the fund investments may perform less well than
expected (another important factor recently) or salaries may grow faster than expected.
Costs have in fact increased significantly in many schemes and as a result some large pension
funds are in deficit.
<p>Defined contribution scheme costs and risks
<p>In a defined contribution scheme the cost of employer contributions is predictable and gener-
ally lower than in defined benefit schemes. However, there is a risk that the resulting pension
falls short of expectations because the fund investments perform poorly or because the annuity
rate (ie the conversion rate from lump sum to regular pension) is unfavourable. This risk falls
on the employee.
<p>The move towards defined contribution schemes
<p>Many leading companies have questioned the financial wisdom of final salary provision.
Defined benefit schemes provide much more value to older and longer-serving employees but
greater labour mobility has led many employers to question this emphasis, particularly in
newer industries with young, high-turnover workforces.
<p>The CIPD 2009 Reward Management Survey established that 52 per cent of employers had
defined benefit schemes but these were much more common in the public sector (91 per cent).
Private sector companies have mainly closed their defined benefit schemes to new entrants
and a number are switching existing employees into defined contribution schemes.
<p>Defined benefit schemes are liked by employees and trade unions because they produce a
guaranteed income. Trade unions are therefore always hostile to any move towards defined
contribution schemes. Such a move will appear to threaten personal security and be detrimen-
tal. Even if the change is restricted to new staff, existing employees may well believe, with some
reason, that it will be applied to them some time.
<p>Rather than change to a defined contribution scheme, some companies have taken steps to
reduce final salary scheme costs. This means retaining final salary provision but with some
benefits scaled back. For example, employers have reduced the accrual rate from 1/60th per
year of service to 1/80th or, more commonly, have increased employee contributions. Employ-
ees and unions are likely to resist such changes but may eventually be persuaded that they are
better than a move towards defined contribution provision.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>400 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>Other types of pension schemes
Hybrid schemes
<p>Hybrid occupational pension schemes aim to split the risk between both parties, although
only 2 per cent of the CIPD respondents had them. For example, a defined benefit scheme
might be provided for staff who meet an age and/or service qualification, with defined contri-
bution provision applying to other staff.
<p>Personal pensions
<p>Employers cannot compel their employees to join their scheme. As an alternative, employees
can take out their own personal pension plan from an approved provider, either as an alterna-
tive to an occupational scheme provided by the employer or because there is no occupational
scheme available. Personal pension schemes can be contracted out of the State pension scheme
and may take contributions from an employer. They are defined contribution (ie money pur-
chase) schemes, which means that the pension is based on what has been paid into the scheme
and not on final salary.
<p>Group schemes
<p>Group schemes are in effect a bundle of individual personal pensions for which the employer
carries out a payroll function by remitting contributions to a pensions provider.
<p>Stakeholder pension
<p>A stakeholder pension is a government-sponsored scheme, primarily designed for lower-paid
employees. It is a low-cost personal pension scheme regulated by the government and pro-
vided through pension companies. Employers who employ five or more staff and do not
provide a suitable occupational pension scheme for their employees are required by law to
offer access to a stakeholder scheme and deduct and pass on employee contributions to the
scheme. But employers do not have to make contributions themselves.
<p>A stakeholder pension is a defined contribution arrangement that satisfies certain conditions,
designed to ensure that it provides good value for money and that members&rsquo; interests are pro-
tected. These conditions are:
<p>Flexible contributions: members must be free to pay whatever contributions they like. &bull;
<p>Charges: the maximum charge is 1.5 per cent of the fund. &bull;
<p>Transfers: the scheme is required to accept transfer payments. &bull;
<p>FSA regulation: all stakeholder schemes are regulated by the Financial Services Agency. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Pension Schemes 401
<p>Investments: the scheme must offer a default investment scheme for members who are &bull;
unwilling to choose between different funds.
<p>Executive pensions
<p>In the private sector, executive pensions are typically provided for by a defined benefit scheme
with an accelerated accrual compared with that for other staff. Instead of providing a maximum
two-thirds pension after 40 years of service (an accrual rate of 1/60th per year of service), a full
pension may be earned after only 20 or 30 years&rsquo; service (equivalent to an accrual rate of
1/30th or 1/45th). The two-thirds pension provided is normally inclusive of any pensions
from previous employments.
<p>The state pension scheme
<p>State pension arrangements are subject to change, and this section is based on the current
(2010) arrangements. The State Pension Scheme has two parts, as described below.
<p>The Basic State Pension
<p>The basic state pension is paid at a standard rate, which may be increased each year as long as
the required number of National Insurance contributions have been paid.
<p>The State Second Pension
<p>The State Second Pension (also known as the State Additional Pension) pays a pension on
earnings for which Class 1 National Insurance contributions have been paid over the years
that fall between the lower and the upper earnings limit. The lower earnings limit corresponds
roughly with the flat-rate pension for a single person while the upper limit is currently about
eight times the lower earning limit. Both limits are adjusted from time to time.
<p>Employers and individuals with a personal pension plan can contract out of the State Second
Pension. Occupational pension schemes can contract out if they meet an overall quality test.
When a scheme is contracted out, both the employer and the employee pay National Insur-
ance contributions at a lower rate.
<p>Advising employees on pensions
<p>The Financial Services Act 1986 and the Pensions Act 1995 place restrictions on the provi-
sion of financial advice to employees. Only those who are directly authorized by one of the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>402 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>regulatory organizations or professional bodies are permitted to give detailed financial
advice on investments. Specific advice on the merits or otherwise of a particular personal
pension plan &ndash; personal pensions are classed as investments by the Financial Services Act &ndash;
can, however, be given to employees:
<p>On the company&rsquo;s occupational pension scheme, since it is not classed as an investment. &bull;
<p>About the general principles to be borne in mind when comparing an occupational &bull;
pension scheme with a personal pension; these could include spelling out the benefits
of the company&rsquo;s scheme, thus leaving employees in a better position to compare the
benefits with whatever an authorized adviser may indicate are the benefits from a per-
sonal plan. What should not be done is to tell people categorically that they will be
better off with the company&rsquo;s scheme or to advise them to look elsewhere.
<p>On their rights, for staff who are leaving, to preserve their pension and the advisability &bull;
of finding out from their prospective employer whether existing rights can be trans-
ferred to their scheme and, if so, what the outcome will be in terms of pension rights at
the new company.
<p>On the general advantages of making additional voluntary contributions. &bull;
<p>HR specialists should restrict themselves to giving factual information. They should never
suggest what people should do. If in any doubt as to how to respond to a request for informa-
tion or advice, it is best to refer the matter to the company&rsquo;s own pension specialist or adviser
or, if none is available, suggest that the employee should talk to an authorized adviser, for
example the individual&rsquo;s own insurance company or bank.
<p>Developing and communicating pensions policies
<p>The pension benefits provided by employers should be developed as an important part of a
coherent total reward package. Good schemes demonstrate that employers care about the
future security and well-being of their employees, and pensions are a valuable means of gaining
and keeping employee commitment to the organization. Younger and more mobile employ-
ees are often indifferent to pensions, but the older they get the more they are concerned, and
these mature employees contribute largely to organizational success.
<p>Careful consideration needs to be given to telling employees about the scheme. They need to
know how it works and how it benefits them &ndash; it is too easy for employees to take pensions for
granted. It is particularly important to communicate the reasons for any changes and how
they will affect staff. This is a demanding situation if a defined benefit scheme is to be replaced
by a defined contribution scheme. HR professionals have a key role to play in being honest
about the real picture and its alternatives, and informing employees of all the implications.</p>

<p>Pension schemes: six tips
If you have a defined benefit (final salary) scheme, evaluate the pros and cons of &bull;
replacing it with a defined contribution (money purchase) scheme for all
employees or only for newly recruited employees.
<p>If you believe it is necessary to switch to a defined contribution scheme, &bull;
evaluate the pros and cons of leaving existing employees in their defined benefit
scheme or transferring them into a defined contribution scheme.
<p>When examining the pros and cons, consider the possible effects on the morale &bull;
of existing employees and the impact it might have on attracting new
employees.
<p>Prepare the case for replacing a defined benefits scheme with great care. It is &bull;
essential to provide convincing reasons for a change that will adversely affect
the terms and conditions of employees.
<p>Communicate the decision through all the channels available. Be prepared for a &bull;
hostile reception.
<p>Consider the possibility of alleviating the negative response by offering &bull;
improvements to other terms and conditions.

Developing Reward Systems
<p>Learning outcomes
<p>On completing this chapter you should know about:
<p>The nature of the development and &bull;

<p>Introduction
<p>The critical and most demanding task that anyone concerned with reward will have to under-
take is that of developing and implementing new or revised reward systems that are mainly
concerned with total rewards, job evaluation, grade and pay structure design, contingent pay
and employee benefits. This is an exacting process of change management and it is where all
the knowledge and experience acquired in the different aspects of reward management as
covered in this book are put into practice to respond to new demands and circumstances.
<p>It is not enough to know what to do; it is just as necessary to know how to do it and even
more necessary to ensure that it has been done as it was supposed to have been done. This
means being absolutely clear about the objectives of the change, planning the change on
the basis of an analysis of the situation and a diagnosis of the causes of any problems,
involving people &ndash; managers and staff alike &ndash; in the change process, communicating to
them about what is happening and why. It also means ensuring that everyone acquires the
skills needed to manage the new processes and play a part in them. Finally it involves

<br>
<p>408 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>planning the implementation, managing the implementation process effectively, and
monitoring and evaluating outcomes to ensure that the objectives of the exercise have
been achieved.
<p>This chapter is mainly concerned with the overall process of developing reward systems, but it
includes examples of the specific approaches that can be used in two main areas for develop-
ment, namely job evaluation and the design of grade and pay structures. The development of
other aspects of the reward system is dealt with in the following chapters: total rewards Chapter
3, contingent pay schemes Chapter 10, point-factor evaluation schemes Chapter 16, grade and
pay structures Chapter 19, and flexible benefits Chapter 25.
<p>The task of developing and implementing reward
systems
<p>The task of development and implementation is a critical one because of the fast-moving
nature of the reward scene. It is necessary constantly to review the system to ensure that it is
meeting business needs and this frequently means innovating new or fundamentally revised
processes. Business and HR strategies change and the reward strategy must change accord-
ingly. This applies to all the main areas of reward management, namely: job evaluation, pay
structures, contingent pay and pensions and benefits. Job evaluation schemes decay in use and
do not fit new organizational arrangements, pay structures are no longer appropriate, contin-
gent pay schemes do not deliver what was expected from them and pension and benefit
schemes have to be changed to meet new legal and fiscal requirements, to cater for different
employee needs or to make them more affordable. The task starts with objective setting and
continues with processes of analysis, diagnosis, evaluation of alternatives and selection of the
most appropriate one, design or development, implementation and evaluation.
<p>Objective setting
<p>It is important at an early stage to be clear about the objectives of any initiative, to clarify what
is to be achieved and, after implementation, serve as a basis for evaluation. Broad objectives
may be formed at the beginning of the exercise but these are likely to be modified during the
project as more information on requirements is obtained and processed. The following are
some examples of reward development project objectives.
<p>BT
<p>At BT their objectives were expressed as follows:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Developing Reward Systems 409
<p>Use the full range of rewards (salary, bonus, benefits and recognition) to recruit and
retain the best people, and to encourage and reward achievement where actions and
behaviours are consistent with the BT values.
<p>Diageo
<p>The objectives at Diageo were to:
<p>support and enable the talent agenda; &bull;
<p>provide clear principles to enable reward decision making in the business; &bull;
<p>align the reward approach with Diageo business strategy; &bull;
<p>enable every employee to understand why they get paid what they get paid; &bull;
<p>have a customer service ethic that results in great execution. &bull;
<p>A finance sector company
<p>The objectives for their &lsquo;fresh approach to reward&rsquo; produced by a finance sector company
were:
<p>Change the emphasis from measuring the job and its accountabilities to recognizing the
person and the contribution they make to the business; reflect the way the organization
is changing by encouraging us to be more responsive to customers; improve reward for
excellent performance by freeing up salary ranges.
<p>Friends Provident
<p>The objectives at Friends Provident were to:
<p>match salaries directly to the market; &bull;
<p>give line managers greater accountability for staff salaries and career progression; &bull;
<p>increase the flexibility of pay arrangements at business unit level; &bull;
<p>facilitate a real and fundamental top-down change in corporate culture; &bull;
<p>reward the best performers by paying salaries above the market rate; &bull;
<p>manage salary costs; &bull;
<p>encourage greater accountability by staff for development of their own competencies. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>410 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>Tesco
<p>At Tesco the objectives of introducing a broad-banded structure were to:
<p>achieve more flexibility in determining pay; &bull;
<p>develop a flatter, more flexible organization; &bull;
<p>reward staff for their contribution; &bull;
<p>link remuneration to responsibility and contribution; &bull;
<p>simplify career planning and job classification. &bull;
<p>The approach to development and implementation
<p>No initiative should be planned without making a business case for it. The extent to which it
will add value rather than create work should be assessed. A value-added approach means that
processes and schemes will not be introduced or updated without assessing the effect they are
expected to have on the engagement and performance of people, on the ability of the organi-
zation to recruit and keep the right sort of employees and, ultimately, on the results achieved
by the organization.
<p>Bearing this in mind, and against the background of a preliminary statement of objectives, the
approach to the development and implementation of reward systems should be evidence-
based, realistic about risks, costs and what can be achieved, focused on how it will be put into
effect, and positive about involving stakeholders and communicating information to them on
proposals and plans and how they will be affected by them.
<p>Evidence-based development
<p>Evidence-based development means considering what needs to be done by reference to an
analysis of the internal and external context and the strengths and weaknesses of the present
reward arrangements, benchmarking good practice elsewhere and consulting relevant research.
This leads to an assessment of requirements that means addressing questions such as:
<p>What are the aims of our reward practices? What do we want to achieve with them? &bull;
<p>What would successful reward practices look like? How would we know? What criteria &bull;
and measures can we use to assess their effectiveness?
<p>What evidence do we have to assess the current level of effectiveness and to highlight &bull;
the strongest and weakest aspects of the current rewards package?
<p>What information can we gather to inform that review and how do we relate financial &bull;
and non-financial information in making any assessment?</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Developing Reward Systems 411
<p>What should we do in response to these findings? &bull;
<p>What level and type of change is appropriate? &bull;
<p>What are the objectives of the change in such terms as higher levels of engagement, and &bull;
how will we know they have been achieved?
<p>How do we pilot, test and implement any changes to maximize their chances of &bull;
success?
<p>How do we ensure continuing success in the future, and how should rewards respond &bull;
to further internal and external changes and developments?
<p>Issues and risk assessment
<p>A major overhaul of a reward system will raise a number of issues involving risks. These need
to be analysed, as in the example from a private sector company given in Table 27.1.
<p>Costs
<p>A new or substantially revised reward system is an investment. But the costs of that investment
need to be assessed to answer the question &lsquo;is it affordable?&rsquo; and thus provide the basis for
deciding whether or not the investment is worthwhile and indicate what can be done to contain
costs, and how costs will be controlled during the project.

</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>412 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>Introducing a new grade structure will almost inevitably incur costs. This is because while the
pay of those who are over-graded (red-circled) will not be reduced, at least in the short term,
the pay of those who are under-graded (green-circled) will have to be increased immediately
or over two or at most three years. Respondents to the e-reward 2007 survey of grade and pay
structures who had introduced new structures indicated that the average proportion of
employees who were red-circled was 4.9 per cent and the proportion of those green-circled (ie
underpaid) was 13.2 per cent. Their costs of dealing with green-circled staff were as high as 8
per cent of pay roll, with an average of just over 2 per cent. It is prudent to assume a cost of 3&ndash;4
per cent.
<p>A reality check
<p>Any proposals or plans should be subjected to a reality check:
<p>Is it worth doing? &ndash; What return will we get on our investment? What&rsquo;s the business &bull;
case in terms of added value? What contribution will it make to supporting the achieve-
ment of the organization&rsquo;s strategic goals?
<p>Can it be done? &bull;
<p>Who does it? &bull;
<p>Have we the resources to do it? &bull;
<p>How do we manage the change? &bull;
<p>Planning for implementation
<p>It is normally assumed that the processes of development and implementation are sequential:
you develop something and then you implement it. This is a mistake. If constant thought is
not given during and throughout the development of a reward system on how it will work and
how it will be made to work, then the implementation will fail. The two go together. Imple-
mentation plans have to take account of the barriers to reward changes revealed in the research
conducted by Brown and Purcell (2007) as shown in Figure 27.1, especially those concerned
with the attitudes of line managers and staff, communications and line managers&rsquo; skills.
<p>The plan for implementation should cover:
<p>the use of pilot tests to identify any operational problems; &bull;
<p>the possibility of phasing the introduction of the changed system so that each step is &bull;
manageable in the time available;
<p>setting up a projects team with an experienced project manager; &bull;
<p>developing an involvement strategy &ndash; deciding who should be involved in the develop- &bull;
ment programme and how they should be involved;</p>

<p>formulating a communications strategy; &bull;
<p>preparing a plan for briefing and training line managers. &bull;
<p>Involvement
<p>Involve stakeholders from the word go &ndash; bottom up as well as top down. It is vital to get the
contribution of line managers, staff and employee representatives as well as senior manage-
ment at all stages of the project. Use attitude surveys, focus groups and workshops to obtain
views, explore issues and exchange ideas. The aim is to achieve ownership and acceptance of
the outcome of the project.
<p>Communication
<p>Effective communications are important because reward systems can be complex and difficult to
understand and therefore need to be explained carefully. Rewards are an emotive issue. So many
personal needs are tied up in them &ndash; for security, recognition, status and so on &ndash; that changes to
them almost inevitably generate emotional and often hostile responses from at least some employ-
ees. People can be suspicious about the reasons for change and feel that it will affect them adversely.
It may be difficult to overcome these fears but a sustained attempt must be made to do so.

<p>Developing Reward Systems 415
<p>Advice from practitioners
<p>The practical advice given below originates from e-reward research interviews (2003 to 2009).
<p>B&amp;Q
<p>B&amp;Q carried out a thorough investigation into the context of the organization &ndash; its internal
and external environment &ndash; and the characteristics of the existing reward system and the views
of all the relevant stakeholders. The aim was to get, via an in-depth research exercise, a full
understanding of the present arrangements, changing employment situation and future
requirements. The company gathered and marshalled data from two perspectives:
<p>External perspective
<p>The analysis of the external environment included:
<p>examination of the changing labour market; &bull;
<p>literature review of employers&rsquo; responses to emerging employment trends and how &bull;
competitors reward staff;
<p>an analysis of the HR and reward strategies typically adopted by high-performing &bull;
organizations;
<p>a survey of 50 high-performing people in a sample of 20 high-performing organiza- &bull;
tions, examining what these staff need in the reward package;
<p>two commissioned surveys of 200 people each to examine &lsquo;external&rsquo; perceptions of &bull;
B&amp;Q as an employer;
<p>a benchmarking exercise using retail industry salary. &bull;
<p>Internal perspective
<p>The analysis of the internal environment included:
<p>a full audit of the current reward investment and its focus; &bull;
<p>consideration of existing use of bonus schemes; &bull;
<p>examination of pay for performance arrangements; &bull;
<p>current provision of financial and non-financial rewards; &bull;
<p>findings of 20 focus groups comprising people from different levels of B&amp;Q and differ- &bull;
ent divisions.</p>

<br>
<p>416 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>To gain an understanding of employee needs and the rewards that motivate its people to
deliver results, B&amp;Q consulted its stakeholders. It canvassed the opinions of middle managers,
team leaders, line managers and store employees generally through a series of focus groups.
The company commissioned a total of 20 focus groups, each consisting of at least 10 people to
facilitate discussion. Their members were representative of the different activities and occupa-
tions in the organization.
<p>Will Astill, B&amp;Q&rsquo;s reward manager, recommends these guiding principles:
<p>Without cooperation change strategies are likely to fail. &bull;
<p>Secure directors&rsquo; &lsquo;buy-in&rsquo; right away. &bull;
<p>Never underestimate the value of in-depth employee consultation. &bull;
<p>Remember that strategy formulation is an evolutionary process. &bull;
<p>Look at how well you communicate your reward package. &bull;
<p>No initiative should be implemented without examining the return on investment. &bull;
<p>Evaluate the effectiveness of programmes and take action as required. &bull;
<p>Budget well in advance. &bull;
<p>A final word from Will Astill:
<p>An overriding theme running through our review was on the desirability of adopting a
strategic approach. It wasn&rsquo;t a case of &lsquo;let&rsquo;s follow best practice&rsquo;, nor were we lured into
adopting the latest &lsquo;fads&rsquo; and &lsquo;fashions&rsquo;. Applying a bespoke system &ndash; taking what
someone has done before and adapting it to your organization &ndash; will not push you
ahead of rivals. Our emphasis throughout the two-year process was on what&rsquo;s right for
the business.
<p>Implement and review &ndash; the BT approach
<p>Kevin Brady, HR Director, Reward and Employee Relations at BT made the following
suggestions:
<p>Business sponsorship and ownership is key &bull;
<p> Secure &lsquo;sponsorship and ownership&rsquo; amongst senior people &ndash; a feeling that the change
is something that they are happy to live with because they have been involved in its
planning and introduction &ndash; it has become their change.
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate resistance &bull;
<p> The level of resistance that may arise when reorganizing reward systems should never be
underestimated, hence the importance of sponsorship, communication and training.</p>

<p>Developing Reward Systems 417
<p>Project management skills are critical &bull;
<p> The project must be carefully planned and managed under a skilled project manager.
<p>Engage, engage, engage! &bull;
<p> Ownership and acceptance are much more likely if the maximum degree of engage-
ment of all concerned is built into the entire change programme.
<p>Clear, consistent communications &bull;
<p> It is imperative to communicate clearly and consistently to staff at every stage of the
process.
<p>Centrica
<p>Centrica&rsquo;s nine success criteria for developing reward systems are:
<p>partnership; &bull;
<p>preparation; &bull;
<p>business engagement; &bull;
<p>employee engagement; &bull;
<p>union engagement; &bull;
<p>financial modelling; &bull;
<p>communications; &bull;
<p>project administration; &bull;
<p>business-as-usual administration. &bull;
<p>GlaxoSmithKline
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t expect people to change overnight and don&rsquo;t try to force change. It is better to
reinforce desirable behaviour than to attempt to enforce a particular way of doing
things&rsquo; (Paul Craven, Compensation Director, R&amp;D).
<p>Lloyds TSB
<p>When developing new reward systems Tim Fevyer, then Senior Manager, Compensation and
Benefits, recommended these guiding principles:
<p>The success of new reward systems depends heavily on talking to people, and asking &bull;
what they would like to see.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>418 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>It is imperative to communicate to staff at every stage of the process &ndash; even in advance &bull;
of launch &ndash; explaining the planned changes, the rationale behind them, and how it
affects the workforce. You then need to continue to give progress reports to employees
and obtain their input on an ongoing basis.
<p>The success of any total reward programme will hinge on the degree to which employ- &bull;
ees feel a sense of ownership &ndash; a feeling amongst people that the change is something
that they are happy to live with because they have been involved in its planning and
introduction &ndash; it has become their change.
<p>It&rsquo;s vital that you get pay right &ndash; otherwise much damage can be done. But once it is, &bull;
don&rsquo;t treat it like a sophisticated lever to influence motivation and empowerment. Pay
is no longer the great differentiator. The only way we are going to keep people is by
engaging them.
<p>Remember that reward processes can indeed underpin structural and cultural change &bull;
and support the achievement of business goals. But not on their own, and they do not
lead change.
<p>Although a fundamentally simple concept, nobody should pretend that total reward is &bull;
not a difficult and time-consuming process to put into practice.
<p>All reward initiatives should be prioritized &ndash; only those processes and schemes that are &bull;
expected to generate the greatest value should be introduced.
<p>A final word from Tim Fevyer:
<p>You cannot succeed without focusing on business goals and understanding what these
mean for your core people goals. Shareholder value was our ultimate objective. But we
unbundled this objective and examined how we would generate shareholder value
through our reward strategy. We wanted to recruit, retain and engage good people. You
might do that in the short term by throwing more money at people but we wanted a
long-term solution that really focused on the individual and their contribution within
the business. Meeting individual needs by providing flexibility within a framework has
enabled us to generate significant value for both employees and the company.
<p>Tesco
<p>Richard Sullivan, Tesco&rsquo;s group reward manager, recommends that managers should keep in
mind these guiding principles:
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the old culture &ndash; it will take time to change it. &bull;
<p>Be prepared to challenge any return to the old ways. &bull;
<p>Management capability is key to communicating issues. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Developing Reward Systems 419
<p>Employee communication is key to having the new system understood. &bull;
<p>Obtain managers&rsquo; input when designing the new process; this will help them explain it &bull;
to others and will increase their commitment to it.
<p>Duncan Brown
<p>Interviews conducted in 2009 by Duncan Brown, Director of the Institute for Employment
Studies (Armstrong, Brown and Reilly, forthcoming), produced the following comments:
<p>You can&rsquo;t adopt a market-based, &lsquo;must be&rsquo; approach. Pay attention to the organiza-
tion, its culture and its needs, gather information and evidence for (reward) change,
but help managers to understand, support and make those changes (a Head of Reward
and Development in a software company).
<p>In a service-driven organization like ours, with lots of professional people, if you come
up with a grand master-plan, people will find 53 reasons why they can&rsquo;t do it. You have
to change more subtly, helping them to see the connections and support it, introducing
change &lsquo;under and up&rsquo; rather than down from the top. People now totally buy into the
behaviours and indicators we have developed (Liz Booth, Director of Human Resources,
NSPCC).
<p>Reward symposium
<p>A symposium of reward specialists as reported by Sandringham (2000) produced the follow-
ing suggestions on developing reward systems that work:
<p>Align your system with the culture of the organization. &bull;
<p>Be careful about generalizations: segmenting staff in the way you segment customers &bull;
may allow you to target your reward system better.
<p>Look at the whole bundle of reward, not just pay; people leave because the job is not &bull;
satisfying or interesting, or because they feel their boss is treating them badly.</p>

<p>Introduction
<p>Reward management involves the management of complex systems. This is a demanding task
requiring the formulation and implementation of policies, control, monitoring and evalua-
tion, pay reviews, procedures, using computers and communicating to employees as explained
in this chapter. The starting point is a clear set of policies.
<p>Reward policies
<p>Reward policies set specific guidelines for decision making and action and therefore provide
the framework for managing a reward system. They indicate what the organization and its
management are expected to do about managing reward and how they will behave in given
circumstances when dealing with reward issues. They can be distinguished from guiding prin-
ciples, which usually express a more generalized philosophy. The key reward policy areas are
described below.
<p>Level of rewards
<p>The policy on the level of rewards indicates whether the company is a high payer, is
content to pay median or average rates of pay or even, exceptionally, accepts that it has to
pay below the average. Pay policy, which is sometimes referred to as the &lsquo;pay stance&rsquo; or
&lsquo;pay posture&rsquo; of a company, will depend on a number of factors. These include the extent
to which the company demands high levels of performance from its employees, the degree </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 423
<p>to which there is competition for good-quality people, the traditional stance of the
company, the organization culture, and whether or not it can or should afford to be a high
payer. A firm may say that, &lsquo;We will pay upper quartile salaries because we want our staff
to be upper quartile performers.&rsquo;
<p>Policies on pay levels will also refer to differentials and the number of steps or grades that
should exist in the pay hierarchy. This will be influenced by the structure of the company.
In today&rsquo;s flatter organizations an extended or complex pay hierarchy may not be required
on the grounds that it does not reflect the way in which work is organized and will constrain
flexibility.
<p>Policies on the level of rewards also cover employee benefits &ndash; pensions, sick pay, health care,
holidays and perks such as company cars.
<p>External competitiveness versus internal equity
<p>A policy needs to be formulated on the extent to which rewards are market driven rather than
equitable. This policy will be influenced by the culture and reward philosophies of the organi-
zation and the pressures on the business to obtain and keep high-quality staff. Any organiza-
tions that have to attract and retain staff who are much in demand and where market rates are
therefore high, may, to a degree, have to sacrifice their ideals (if they have them) of internal
equity to the realism of the market place. They will provide &lsquo;market pay&rsquo;; in other words, they
will be &lsquo;market driven&rsquo;.
<p>The pay management process must cope as best it can when the irresistible force of market
pressures meets the immovable object of internal equity. There will always be some degree of
tension in these circumstances, and while no solution will ever be simple or entirely satisfac-
tory, there is one basic principle that can enhance the likelihood of success. That principle is
to make explicit and fully identifiable the compromises with internal equity that are made and
have to be made in response to market pressures.
<p>The policy may indicate that market considerations will drive levels of pay in the organization.
It may, however, allow for the use of market supplements &ndash; a payment that reflects market
rates in addition to the rate for a job as determined by internal equity . The policy may lay
down that these payments should be reviewed regularly and no longer offered if they are
unnecessary. Market supplements for those who have them may not be withdrawn (the people
concerned would not lose pay), but adjustments may be made to pay progression to bring
their rates more into line with those for comparable jobs. Market pay and market supplements
can lead to gender inequalities if, as is often the case, men in comparable jobs are paid more
generally or more men get market supplements than women. Equal pay case law has ruled that
market pay and market supplements should be &lsquo;objectively justified&rsquo;, and the requirement to
do this should be included in the pay policy.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>424 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>The 2007 e-reward survey of grade and pay structures revealed that respondents with market
supplements adopted the following policies when such supplements were no longer required:
<p>remove immediately &ndash; 33 per cent; &bull;
<p>retain until upgraded &ndash; 30 per cent; &bull;
<p>reduce progressively &ndash; 19 per cent; &bull;
<p>protect in line with policy &ndash; 18 per cent. &bull;
<p>Segmentation
<p>Segmentation involves varying the reward package for different jobs or to reflect the types and
levels of contribution people make, or providing rewards that are tailored to meet individual
needs.
<p>A policy on segmentation will recognize that parts of the workforce and individuals in the suc-
cessive stages of their career may be motivated by different combinations of rewards. A total
rewards package can be tailored to meet these needs. Rewards may be segmented to take
account of key employee differences. This could mean individual performance-related pay for
some, team reward for others, and other forms of pay progression and recognition rather than
incentives for a third group. This is a flexible approach to reward management although it
should be flexibility within a framework, the framework being provided by guiding principles
that apply to all aspects of reward.
<p>Assimilation policies
<p>The introduction of a new or considerably revised pay structure means that policies have to be
developed on how existing employees should be assimilated into it. These policies cover where
people should be placed in their new grades and what happens to them if their new grade and
pay range means that their existing rate is above or below the new scale for their job. The
policy should therefore cover &lsquo;red-circling&rsquo; (identifying and dealing with overpaid people) and
&lsquo;green-circling&rsquo; (identifying and dealing with underpaid people). In the case of red-circled
staff, &lsquo;protection&rsquo; policies may have to be formulated to safeguard their existing rates of pay.
In the case of green-circled staff, the policy may have to determine when (not if) their pay
should be increased to fit into the new scale. It is sometimes necessary to save costs by phasing
the increase, and this should be included as a possible policy.
<p>Protection policies
<p>Protection (sometimes called safeguarding) is the process of dealing with the situation when,
following the introduction of a new pay structure, the existing pay of some employees may be </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 425
<p>above the maximum for their new grade and they are therefore &lsquo;red-circled&rsquo;. In these circum-
stances the general rule is that no one should suffer a reduction in their present rate of pay.
Beyond this, the issues are what exactly is to be protected and whether or not the protection
should be for a limited period, and if so, for how long.
<p>The usual approach is to allow staff to continue to earn any increments to which they are
entitled under existing arrangements up to the maximum of their present scale. They are
also entitled to receive any across-the-board (cost of living) increases awarded to staff gen-
erally for the protection period, if it is limited, or for as long as they remain in their present
job if there is no limit (in the latter case they are on what is sometimes called a &lsquo;personal to
job holder&rsquo; scale). If the period is limited, they will no longer be entitled to general increases
after the limit has been reached until their rate of pay falls within the new scale for their job.
They will then be entitled to the same increases as any other staff in their grade. When the
individual concerned leaves the job, the scale of pay for the job reverts to the standard range
as set up following job evaluation.
<p>The argument for limiting the protection period is that, unless this is done, equal pay prob-
lems may arise because an inequitable differential will have been perpetuated. The Equal
Opportunities Commission (EOC) in its Good Practice Guide on Job Evaluation Schemes
Free of Sex Bias, stated that red-circling &lsquo;should not be used on such a scale that it amounts to
sex discrimination&rsquo;. And as suggested by the Equal Pay Task Force: &lsquo;The use of red or green
circling which maintains a difference in pay between men and women over more than a phase-
in period of time will be difficult to justify.&rsquo;
<p>The respondents to the 2007 e-reward survey of grade and pay structures adopted the follow-
ing protection periods:
<p>unlimited &ndash; 53 per cent; &bull;
<p>one year &ndash; 12 per cent; &bull;
<p>two years &ndash; 10 per cent; &bull;
<p>three years &ndash; 6 per cent; &bull;
<p>four years &ndash; 15 per cent; &bull;
<p>five to ten years &ndash; 4 per cent. &bull;
<p>The role of line managers
<p>The extent to which the responsibility for rewards should be devolved to line managers is a
policy decision. The aim may be to devolve it as far as possible, bearing in mind the need to
ensure that other reward policy guidelines are followed and that consistent decisions are made
across the organization by line managers. The policy may cover the level of decisions managers </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>426 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>can make, the guidance that should be made available to them and how consistency will be
achieved.
<p>Transparency
<p>Traditionally, organizations in the private sector have kept information about pay policies
secret. This is no longer a tenable position. Without transparency, people will believe that the
organization has something to hide, often with reason. There is no chance of building a satis-
factory psychological contract unless the organization spells out its reward policies and prac-
tices. Transparency is achieved through involvement and communication.
<p>Controlling reward
<p>The implementation of reward policies and procedures should be monitored and controlled
to ensure that value for money is obtained. Control is easier if the grade and pay structure is
well defined and clear guidelines exist on how it and the benefits arrangements should be
managed. Control should be based on forecasts, budgets and costings, as described below, and
by monitoring and evaluating the implementation of reward policies as discussed in the next
part of this chapter.
<p>Reward forecasts
<p>It is necessary to forecast future payroll costs taking into account the number of people
employed and the impact of pay reviews and contingent pay awards. The cost implications of
developments such as a revised job evaluation scheme, a new grade and pay structure or a flex-
ible benefits scheme also have to be forecast.
<p>Reward budgets
<p>Pay review budgets set out the increase in payroll costs that will result for either general or
individual pay reviews and are used for cost forecasts generally and as the basis for the guide-
lines issued to line managers on conducting individual reviews.
<p>Total payroll budgets are based on the number of people employed in different jobs and their
present and forecast rates of pay. In a budgetary control system they are aggregated from the
budgets prepared by departmental managers but HR provides guidance on the allowances that
should be made for pay increases. The aim is to maintain control over payroll costs and restrain
managers from the temptation to overpay their staff.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 427
<p>Costing reward processes
<p>Proposed changes to the reward system need to be costed for approval by senior management.
The costs would include development costs such as consultants&rsquo; fees, software, literature,
additional staff and, possibly, the opportunity costs arising when staff are seconded to a devel-
opment project.
<p>Implementation costs also have to be projected. A new grade and pay structure, for example,
can easily result in an increase to the payroll of 3&ndash;4 per cent. New contingent pay schemes may
also cost more, although the aim should be to make them self-financing.
<p>Monitoring and evaluating reward policies and
practices
<p>The effectiveness of reward policies and practices should be monitored and evaluated against
the requirements of the organization. Monitoring is carried out through compa-ratio analysis,
attrition analysis, assessing added value and the use of attitude surveys. Evaluation, as described
in more detail in Chapter 29, should compare outcomes with the objectives set for the new
practice (this is why setting objectives for reward initiatives is so important).
<p>Compa-ratio analysis
<p>A compa-ratio (short for &lsquo;comparative ratio&rsquo;) measures the relationship in a graded pay struc-
ture between actual and policy rates of pay as a percentage. The policy value used is the mid-
point or reference point in a pay range, which represents the &lsquo;target rate&rsquo; for a fully competent
individual in any job in the grade. This point is aligned with market rates in accordance with
the organization&rsquo;s market stance (its policy on the relationship between its levels of pay and
market rates).
<p>Compa-ratios can be used to define the extent to which pay policy is achieved (the relationship
between the policy and actual rates of pay). The analysis of compa-ratios indicates what action
may have to be taken to slow down or accelerate increases if compa-ratios are too high or too
low compared with the policy level. This is sometimes called &lsquo;mid-point management&rsquo;.
Compa-ratios can also be used to measure where an individual is placed in a pay range, and
therefore provide information on the size of pay increases when a pay matrix is used, as
described later in this chapter.
<p>Compa-ratios are calculated as follows:
<p>actual rate of pay
mid or reference point of range
<p>&times; 100</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>428 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>A compa-ratio of 100 per cent means that actual pay and policy pay are the same. Compa-
ratios that are higher or lower than 100 per cent mean that, respectively, pay is above or below
the policy target rate. For example, if the target (policy) rate in a range were &pound;20,000 and the
average pay of all the individuals in the grade were &pound;18,000, the compa-ratio would be 90 per
cent. Compa-ratios establish differences between policy and practice. The reasons for such
differences need to be established.
<p>Analysing attrition
<p>Attrition or slippage takes place when employees enter jobs at lower rates of pay than the pre-
vious incumbents. If this happens payroll costs will go down, given an even flow of starters and
leavers and a consistent approach to the determination of rates of pay. In theory attrition can
help to finance pay increases within a range. It has been claimed that fixed incremental systems
can be entirely self-financing because of attrition, but the conditions under which this can
happen are so exceptional that it probably never happens.
<p>Attrition can be calculated by the formula: total percentage increase to payroll arising from
general or individual pay increases minus total percentage increase in average rates of pay. If
it can be proved that attrition is going to take place, the amount involved can be taken into
account as a means of at least partly financing individual pay increases. Attrition in a pay
system with regular progression through ranges and a fairly even flow of starters and leavers is
typically between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, but this should not be regarded as a norm.
<p>Assessing added value
<p>Assessing the added value or value for money provided by existing practices, or by new prac-
tices when they are implemented, is a major consideration when monitoring and evaluating
reward management processes. Evaluating the cost of innovations may lead to the reconsid-
eration of proposals in order to ensure that they will provide added value. Evaluating the value
for money obtained from existing reward practices leads to the identification of areas for
improvement.
<p>Affordability should be a major issue when reviewing reward management developments and
existing practices. Added value is achieved when the benefits of a reward practice either exceed
its cost or at least justify the cost. At the development stage it is therefore necessary to carry out
cost&ndash;benefit assessments. The two fundamental questions to be answered are: 1) &lsquo;What busi-
ness needs will this proposal meet?&rsquo; and 2) &lsquo;How will the proposal meet the needs?&rsquo; The costs
and benefits of existing practices should also be assessed on the same basis.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 429
<p>Attitude surveys
<p>An attitude survey is a valuable means of evaluating and monitoring reward practices by
assessing the views of those at the receiving end of pay policies as a basis for taking action. An
example of a reward attitude survey is given in Appendix A.
<p>Conducting pay reviews
<p>Pay reviews are general or &lsquo;across-the-board&rsquo; reviews in response to movements in the cost of
living or market rates, or following pay negotiations with trade unions or individual reviews
that determine the pay progression of individuals in relation to their performance or contri-
bution. They are one of the most visible aspects of reward management (the other is job
grading) and are an important means of implementing the organization&rsquo;s reward policies and
demonstrating to employees how these policies operate.
<p>Employees expect that general reviews will maintain the purchasing power of their pay by
compensating for increases in the cost of living. They will want their levels of pay to be com-
petitive with what they could earn elsewhere. And they will want to be rewarded fairly and
equitably for the contribution they make.
<p>General reviews
<p>General reviews take place when employees are given an increase in response to general market
rate movements, increases in the cost of living, or union negotiations. General reviews are
often combined with individual reviews but employees are usually informed of both the
general and individual components of any increase they receive. Alternatively the general
review may be conducted separately to enable better control to be achieved over costs and to
focus employees&rsquo; attention on the performance-related aspect of their remuneration.
<p>Some organizations have completely abandoned the use of across-the-board reviews. They
argue that the decision on what people should be paid should be an individual matter, taking
into account the personal contribution people are making and their &lsquo;market worth&rsquo; &ndash; how
they as individuals are valued in the market place. This enables the organization to adopt a
more flexible approach to allocating pay increases in accordance with the perceived value of
individuals to the organization.</p>

<p>The steps required to conduct a general review

<p>2. Analyse data on pay settlements made by comparable organizations and rates of
inflation.
<p>3. Conduct negotiations with trade unions as required.
<p>4. Calculate costs.
<p>5. Adjust the pay structure &ndash; by either increasing the pay brackets of each grade by
the percentage general increase, or by increasing pay reference points by the
overall percentage and applying different increases to the upper or lower limits of
the bracket, thus altering the shape of the structure.
<p>6. Inform employees.
<p>Individual reviews
<p>Individual pay reviews determine contingent pay increases or bonuses. The e-reward 2004
survey of contribution pay found that the average size of the contingent pay awards made by
respondents was 3.5 per cent (it was 3.3 per cent in 2004). Individual awards may be based on
ratings; an overall assessment that does not depend on ratings or ranking as discussed below.
<p>Individual pay reviews based on ratings
<p>Managers propose increases on the basis of their performance management ratings within a given
pay review budget and in accordance with pay review guidelines. Eighty per cent of the respondents
to the e-reward 2009 survey of contingent pay used ratings to inform contingent pay decisions.
<p>There is a choice of methods. The simplest way is to have a direct link between the rating and
the pay increase; for example:
<p>Rating Increase (%)
<p>A 6
<p>B 4
<p>C 3
<p>D 2
<p>E 0</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 431
<p>This approach was used by 36 per cent of the respondents to the e-reward 2009 survey.
<p>A more sophisticated approach is to use a pay matrix, as illustrated in Table 28.1. This indi-
cates the percentage increase payable for different performance ratings according to the posi-
tion of the individual&rsquo;s pay in the pay range. This is sometimes referred to as an &lsquo;individual
compa-ratio&rsquo; and expresses pay as a percentage of the mid-point in a range. A compa-ratio of
100 per cent means that the salary would be at the mid-point.
<p>This approach was used by 41 per cent of the respondents to the e-reward 2009 survey.
<p>Linking pay reviews to performance reviews
<p>Many people argue that linking performance management too explicitly to pay prejudices the
essential developmental nature of performance management. However, realistically, it is
accepted that decisions on performance-related or contribution-related increases have to be
based on some form of assessment. One solution is to &lsquo;decouple&rsquo; performance management
and the pay review by holding them several months apart, and 47 per cent of the respondents
to the e-reward 2009 survey did this. There is still a read-across but it is not so immediate.
Some try to do without formulaic approaches (ratings and pay matrices) altogether, although
it is impossible to dissociate contingent pay completely from some form of assessment.
<p>Table 28.1 A pay matrix
<p>Percentage pay increase according to performance rating and position

<p>Excellent 12% 10% 8% 6%

<p>Developing 4% 3% 0 0
<p>Ineligible 0 0 0 0</p>

<br>
<p>432 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>Doing without ratings
<p>Twenty per cent of the respondents to the 2009 e-reward survey of contingent pay did without
ratings. One respondent to the e-reward survey explained that in the absence of ratings, the
approach used was &lsquo;informed subjectivity&rsquo;, which meant considering ongoing performance in
the form of overall contribution.
<p>Some companies adopt what might be called a holistic approach. Managers propose where
people should be placed in the pay range for their grade, taking into account their contribu-
tion and pay relative to others in similar jobs, their potential and the relationship of their
current pay to market rates. The decision may be expressed in the form of a statement that an
individual is now worth &pound;30,000 rather than &pound;28,000. The increase is 7 per cent, but what
counts is the overall view about the value of a person to the organization, not the percentage
increase to that person&rsquo;s pay.
<p>Ranking
<p>Ranking is carried out by managers who place staff in a rank order according to an overall
assessment of relative contribution or merit and then distribute performance ratings through
the rank order. The top 10 per cent could get an A rating, the next 15 per cent a B rating and
so on. The ratings determine the size of the reward. A forced ranking or &lsquo;vitality curve&rsquo; system
may be used to compel managers to conform to predetermined proportions of staff in each
grade. But ranking depends on fair, consistent and equitable assessments, which cannot be
guaranteed, and assumes that there is some sort of standard distribution of ability across the
organization, which may not be the case.
<p>Guidelines to managers on conducting individual pay reviews
<p>Whichever approach is adopted, guidelines have to be issued to managers on how they
should conduct reviews. These guidelines will stipulate that they must keep within their
budgets and may indicate the maximum and minimum increases that can be awarded with
an indication of how awards could be distributed. For example, when the budget is 4 per
cent overall, it might be suggested that a 3 per cent increase should be given to the majority
of staff and the others given higher or lower increases as long as the total percentage increase
does not exceed the budget. Managers in some companies are instructed that they must
follow a forced pattern of distribution (a forced choice system) but only 8 per cent of the
respondents to the 2003 CIPD survey (Armstrong and Baron, 2004) used this method. To
help them to explore alternatives, managers may be provided with a spreadsheet facility in
which the spreadsheets contain details of the existing rates of staff and can be used to model
alternative distributions on a &lsquo;what if&rsquo; basis. Managers may also be encouraged to &lsquo;fine tune&rsquo;
their pay recommendations to ensure that individuals are on the right track within their
grade according to their level of performance, competence and time in the job compared </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 433
<p>with their peers. To do this, they need guidelines on typical rates of progression in relation
to performance, skill or competence, and specific guidance on what they can and should do.
They also need information on the relative positions of their staff in the pay structure in
relation to the policy guidelines.
<p>Conducting individual pay reviews
<p>Steps required to conduct individual pay reviews
<p>1. Agree budget.
<p>2. Prepare and issue guidelines on the size, range and distribution of awards and on
methods of conducting the review.
<p>3. Provide advice and support.
<p>4. Review proposals against budget and guidelines and agree modifications to them if
necessary.
<p>5. Summarize and cost proposals and obtain approval.
<p>6. Update payroll.
<p>7. Inform employees.
<p>A description of how a company makes individual pay decisions is given below.
<p>Making pay decisions in a finance sector company
<p>We look at a number of things when making a decision on an individual&rsquo;s pay. One
will be the size of the role as determined by job evaluation, and we also consider
market data and location to determine the average salary that you would expect to pay
for that role. We then look at how the individual has performed over the last 12
months: Have they contributed what was expected of them? Have they contributed
above and beyond their peers? Have they underperformed in respect of what was
required of them? These are not ratings, they are just guidelines given to managers as
to whether the individual should be given an average, above-average or below-average
increase. We have a devolved budget and managers have to make decisions as to what
percentage they should give to different people. We suggest that if, for example, a
manager has six people carrying out the same roles then, from an equal pay point of
view, if they are delivering at the same level and are all competent, they should be
getting similar salaries. Individuals paid below the market rate who are performing
effectively may get a bigger pay rise to bring them nearer the market rate for the role.</p>

<br>
<p>434 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>It is essential to provide advice, guidance and training to line managers as required. Some
managers will be confident and capable from the start. Others will have a lot to learn.
<p>Reward procedures
<p>Reward procedures deal with grading jobs, fixing rates of pay and handling appeals.
<p>Grading jobs
<p>The procedures for grading jobs set out how job evaluation should be used to grade a new job
or re-grade an existing one. A point-factor evaluation scheme that has defined grades may be
used for all new jobs and to deal with requests for re-grading. However, an analytical matching
process (see Chapter 16) may be used to compare the role profiles of the jobs to be graded with
grade or level profiles or profiles of benchmark jobs. This is likely to be the case in large organ-
izations and for broad-banded structures.
<p>Fixing rates of pay on appointment
<p>The procedure should indicate how much freedom line managers and HR have to pay above
the minimum rate for the job. The freedom may be limited to, say, 10 per cent above the
minimum or two or three pay points on an incremental scale. More scope is sometimes
allowed to respond to market rate pressures or to attract particularly well-qualified staff by
paying up to the reference point or target salary in a pay range, subject to HR approval and
bearing in mind the need to provide scope for contingent pay increases. If recruitment supple-
ments or premia are used the rules for offering them to candidates must be clearly defined.
<p>Promotion increases
<p>The procedure will indicate what is regarded as a meaningful increase on promotion, often 10
per cent or more. To avoid creating anomalies, the level of pay has to take account of what
other people are paid who are carrying out work at a similar level, and it is usual to lay down
a maximum level that does not take the pay of the promoted employee above the reference
point for the new range.
<p>Appeals
<p>It is customary to include the right to appeal against gradings as part of a job evaluation pro-
cedure. Appeals against pay decisions are usually made through the organization&rsquo;s grievance
procedure.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 435
<p>The use of computers in reward management
<p>The ever-evolving world of IT and electronic communications has changed the way salary
data are reviewed and managed quite radically in the last decade. Applications and data can
now be accessed and assessed from almost anywhere in the world; organizations are making
increasing use of the internet, data on market rates and pay settlements is published on the
internet and users can communicate at speed through e-mail. Computers and the software
are becoming more and more powerful and sophisticated. HR or reward specialists can
analyse the implications of new grade structures, cost pay review matrices and plan salary
reviews, and options can rapidly be costed through simple changes on a spreadsheet. &lsquo;Self-
serve&rsquo; systems enable line management to carry out a number of reward tasks, such as pay
reviews. Increasing use is being made of computers to support reward administration and
decision making in the areas of:
<p>providing a reward database; &bull;
<p>job evaluation; &bull;
<p>grade and pay structure modelling; &bull;
<p>pay review modelling; &bull;
<p>equal pay reviews. &bull;
<p>The reward database
<p>The reward database stores data on employees&rsquo; pay, earnings and benefits so that it can be
updated, processed and communicated as information to users. It consists of systematically
organized and interrelated sets of files (collections of records serving as the basic unit of data
storage) and allows for combinations of data to be selected as required by different users. The
database contains information imported from the payroll or personnel information system.
This information may include personal and job details, job grade, basic pay, position in the
pay range (compa-ratio), earnings through variable pay, pay history (progression, and general
and individual pay increases), performance management ratings, details of employee benefits,
pension contributions, contributions to Save as You Earn schemes and the choices made
under a flexible benefits system, including pension contributions.
<p>The database can be used, for example, to:
<p>Produce listings of employees by job category, job grade, rate of pay, position in range &bull;
and size in actual or percentage terms of the last increase and, if required, previous
individual performance pay increases.
<p>Generate reports analysing distributions of pay by grade, including compa-ratios &bull;
for each grade and the organization as a whole. Extracts from these reports can be </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>436 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>downloaded to the personal computers of managers responsible for pay decisions
to assist them in conducting pay reviews.
<p>Initiate and print notifications of pay increases and update the payroll database. &bull;
<p>Use electronic mail facilities to transmit data. &bull;
<p>In using the database it is necessary that the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 are
met. Among other things, this requires that personal data held for any purpose should not be
used or disclosed in any manner incompatible with that purpose, and appropriate security
measures must be taken against unauthorized access to or disclosure of those data. If data are
going to be downloaded it will be essential to control who gets what. The importance of data
protection will also have to be spelt out to managers.
<p>Computer-aided job evaluation
<p>Computers can be used to help directly with job evaluation processes, as described in
Chapter 16.
<p>Software packages
<p>Micro-based software packages have been developed to carry out the various processes referred
to above. Proprietary software is usually designed as a standard software shell within which
there are a number of functions that allow users to customize the system to meet their own
needs.
<p>Grade and pay structure modelling
<p>Software packages available from firms such as Link Consultants and Pilat UK use the output
from a computerized job evaluation exercise contained in the database to model alternative
grade structures by reference to the distribution of points scores against the existing pay
rates for the jobs covered by job evaluation. The computer produces a scattergram and a
trend line showing the relationship between pay and the job evaluation scores. The pro-
gramme will then enable a proposed grade structure to be superimposed on the scattergram,
identifying those jobs above or below the new grade boundaries. The cost of bringing the
pay of those below the new boundaries to the minimum rate for their new grades is then
calculated by the computer.
<p>Alternative grade configurations can then be superimposed on the scattergram to find out if
the number of jobs below the lower limits of their new grades will be reduced. The computer
then calculates the lower costs of bringing the fewer jobs which are now below the minimum
up to the minimum. This modelling process can continue until the optimum configuration of
grades from the point of view of costs is achieved. A decision can then be made about whether </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 437
<p>this grade structure or one of the others should be selected. The lowest-cost option would not
necessarily be chosen as it might produce an unmanageable grade structure, for example
having too few grades with too much scope for pay progression within them.
<p>Pay review modelling
General reviews
<p>The computer can use the database to provide information on the total cost of a proposed
general pay review and the effect this will have on other costs, for example pensions. The
program can then model alternative levels. Computers can model the effect on costs of alter-
native increases.
<p>Individual reviews
<p>It is now increasingly typical to manage pay reviews for an organization on a spreadsheet,
through which a number of alternative options can be tested. Spreadsheets provide line man-
agers with a worksheet, divided into cells, into which can be inserted text, numbers or formu-
lae. This allows the user to carry out complex &lsquo;what if&rsquo; analyses of the impact on the pay review
budget of alternative distributions of awards to staff. Analyses can be saved as a separate file for
future recall when the proposals are approved. Spreadsheets can be printed out in report or
graphical form. In some organizations, line managers carry out the modelling themselves
using a spreadsheet with data provided by HR, and their conclusions can be reviewed and
approved and aggregated into an overall cost of the review analysed by departments. In others,
HR and reward specialists carry out salary reviews for each function or department with the
relevant line managers on-site, using a laptop.
<p>The problem with spreadsheets is that they can be quite complex and do not always work well
in larger applications. Software such as the Pay Modeller marketed by Link Consultants may
be the answer to these problems.
<p>Equal pay reviews
<p>Software is available to support equal pay reviews and analyses. These range from database
tools that enable data to be imported from a range of sources to generate pay gap analyses,
such as the e-Review Equal Pay toolkit, to more sophisticated tools that allow for a broader
range of analysis possibilities using different data cuts, including the tool developed by Link.
<p>Communicating to employees
<p>Transparency is important. Employees need to know how reward policies will affect them and
how pay and grading decisions have been made. They need to be convinced that the system is </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>438 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>fair. They should also be given information on the value of their total reward package. But bear
in mind that as Erickson (2004) pointed out: &lsquo;Employees won&rsquo;t hear unless they feel they&rsquo;re
being listened to &ndash; no matter how professionally you handle top-down communications.&rsquo;
<p>Communicating to employees collectively
<p>Employees and their representatives should be informed about the guiding principles and
policies that underpin the reward system and the reward strategies that drive it. They should
understand the grade and pay structure, how grading decisions are made, including the job
evaluation system, how their pay can progress within the structure, the basis upon which con-
tingent pay increases are determined and policies on the provision of benefits, including details
of a flexible benefits scheme if one is available.
<p>Communicating to individual employees
<p>Individual employees should understand how their grade, present rate of pay and pay increases
have been determined, and the pay opportunities available to them &ndash; the scope for pay pro-
gression and how their contribution will be assessed through performance management. They
should be informed of the value of the benefits they receive so that they are aware of their total
remuneration and, if appropriate, how they can exercise choice over the range or scale of their
benefits through a flexible benefits scheme.
<p>As many means as possible should be used to communicate to employees. Possible methods
include:
<p>individual briefings; &bull;
<p>team briefings; &bull;
<p>road shows and open days; &bull;
<p>intranet, including bulletin boards; &bull;
<p>CD-ROMs; &bull;
<p>newsletters; &bull;
<p>individual letters to employees&rsquo; home addresses; &bull;
<p>meetings, Q&amp;A sessions, focus groups; &bull;
<p>demonstrations with computer modelling; &bull;
<p>telephone and e-mail helplines; &bull;
<p>one-to-one consultations. &bull;</p>

systems

<p>Introduction
<p>A cold economic climate makes it more essential than ever to obtain value for money from
investment in any HR activity. This particularly applies to reward, which is the most expensive
of them all. The best-performing firms, as established by Watson Wyatt (2002), make greater
efforts than others to measure reward plan effectiveness.
<p>The CIPD 2009 reward management survey found that only 32 per cent of the respondents
assess the impact of their reward practices and no more than 54 per cent could calculate the
size of their total remuneration spend (pay, benefits and other financial rewards plus National
Insurance Contributions). Just 12 per cent of respondents to the e-reward 2009 survey of con-
tingent pay evaluate the effectiveness of their individual performance-related pay schemes, a
remarkably low proportion considering the cost of such schemes and the problems of making
them work well.
<p>In their research on the evaluation of changes in pay structures, amongst 15 large employers
Corby et al (2003) found that only one organization made any real attempt systematically to
evaluate the effectiveness of the changes, and most managers were cynical about the value of
attempting to do so. The researchers established that &lsquo;significant decisions are the outcomes of
<p>440 </p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Evaluating Reward Management 441
<p>a social and political process only partly shaped by the evidence.&rsquo; Rather than spending time
and incurring the cost of carrying out detailed monitoring, which would not provide conclu-
sive results, the research indicated that managers often relied on anecdotal evidence. They
used an approach to evaluation categorized by Kearns (1995) as &lsquo;we think it worked.&rsquo;
<p>In his classic 1995 article &lsquo;On the folly of rewarding A, while hoping for B&rsquo;, Steven Kerr com-
mented that: &lsquo;Managers who complain about lack of motivation in their workers might do
well to consider the possibility that the reward systems they have installed are paying off for
behaviours other than what they are seeking.&rsquo;
<p>Other researchers and commentators have come to broadly similar conclusions:
<p>The study found that few, if any, employers, built in a monitoring and evaluation
process as part of the introduction of an individual performance-related pay scheme.
This was because most employers did not have clearly articulated objectives for intro-
ducing such schemes against which they could measure subsequent success or failure.
Furthermore, little thought appeared to [be given to] the indicators that could be used
to measure the effectiveness of the scheme and the type of information that should be
collected. (Thompson, 1992)
<p>Little evidence demonstrates the efficacy of rewards, although much evidence indicates
that rewards and their design loom large in management attention. (Pfeffer, 1998)
<p>Compensation is a complex and often confusing topic. Although compensation costs
comprise, on average, 65 per cent to 70 per cent of total costs in the US economy and are
likewise substantial elsewhere, most managers are not sure of the likely consequences of
spending either more, or less on employees or of paying employees in different ways.
(Gerhart and Rynes, 2003)
<p>There are no less than six substitutes that managers often use for the best evidence;
&lsquo;obsolete knowledge, personal experience, specialist skills, hype, dogma and mindless
mimicry of top performers&rsquo;. (Pfeffer and Sutton, 2006)
<p>Why evaluate?
<p>Vast amounts of money are being wasted on pay and benefits but organizations are not getting
added value from this expenditure because they are not measuring the effectiveness of their
reward practices. While the literature and practice in the area of, for example, learning and
development, is replete with models and debates regarding the best methodology to apply to
judge &lsquo;the ROI on training&rsquo;, the reward literature is remarkably silent on this issue.
<p>The reasons for evaluating the effectiveness of reward policies and practices are:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>442 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>to establish whether reward innovations are functioning as planned and achieving the &bull;
objectives set for them;
<p>to find out how well the established reward practices are working and identify any &bull;
problems;
<p>to ensure that value for money is obtained from the different parts of the reward &bull;
system;
<p>to provide an evidence-based approach to improving reward practices. &bull;
<p>Why don&rsquo;t people evaluate?
<p>Possible reasons for the lack of interest in evaluation include:
<p>The problem of isolating pay and rewards to assess their effects. A wide range of vari- &bull;
ables, often intangible, are generally involved. For example, performance management,
communications and other factors as well as the plan design will impact on the success
of performance-related pay initiatives. Changes in pay are also typically accompanied
by changes in associated HR processes, with job evaluation exercises, for example, often
accompanied by changes in job content and organization design.
<p>The difficulty of carrying out controlled research studies and comparative experiments &bull;
with different approaches to pay and rewards.
<p>Perceived lack of time and resources to evaluate (even though stronger evidence of &bull;
effectiveness might lead to more resources being allocated to the reward management
function).
<p>A bewildering array of sources is used to generate management advice. Pfeffer and &bull;
Sutton (2006) cite references to Shakespeare, Billy Graham, Jack Welch, Tony Soprano,
fighter pilots, Santa Claus and Attila the Hun.
<p>Lack of training and skills in statistics, finance, quantitative methods, research and &bull;
other relevant disciplines amongst the HR community (although it might be thought
that this would be less true about reward practitioners than other HR professionals
given the requirement for numeracy and, frequently, their finance background).
<p>Sheer laziness, especially when practitioners are not being pushed by others to do it &bull;
(though HR functions are coming under more pressure to justify their existence).
<p>Steven Kerr (1995) commented on this as follows:
<p>One major reason [for failure to evaluate] is that the individuals (in human resources,
or organization development) who would normally be responsible for conducting such </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Evaluating Reward Management 443
<p>evaluations are the same ones often charged with introducing the change effort in the
first place. Having convinced top management to spend money, say, on outside consult-
ants, they usually are quite animated afterwards in collecting rigorous vignettes and
anecdotes about how successful the program was. The last thing many desire is a formal,
revealing evaluation. Although members of top management may actually hope for
such systematic evaluation, their reward systems continue to reward ignorance in this
area. And if the HR department abdicates its responsibility, who is to step into the
breach? The consultants themselves? Hardly! They are likely to be too busy collecting
anecdotal &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; of their own, for use on their next client.
<p>What can be done about it?
<p>Interesting suggestions on how to evaluate reward have been made by researchers Corby et al
(2003) Heneman (2002), Kanungo and Mendonca (1988) and Scott, McMullen and Sperling
(2006).
<p>Corby et al (2003) advise that practitioners should have a realistic view of what is achievable,
focus on evaluation in only a few key areas rather than compiling a wish-list, use existing
mechanisms such as employee attitude surveys and human capital reports as far as possible,
and consider perceptions and qualitative criteria, not just &lsquo;hard&rsquo; cost and business figures.
<p>Heneman remarks that the evaluation of the effectiveness of a strategic reward system is often
overlooked among many organizations, but it is an indispensable final step in the process of
implementing a compensation programme. Indeed, assessing the effectiveness of any proce-
dure is just as important, if not more so, as its design and execution. Since it is often compli-
cated to evaluate the effectiveness of a reward programme in terms of financial performance,
so-called &lsquo;soft factors&rsquo; such as employee behavioural reactions to the programme are some-
times an acceptable replacement.
<p>Kanungo and Mendonca (1988) advocate a final review stage in introducing new reward
systems. This consists of reformulating the reward package objectives or redesigning the
reward system or both, based upon the diagnosis of the present reward system. At this stage, a
great deal of learning takes place, as management reflects on the perceptions and expectations
of its employees and their impact on organizational goals. It is also a time for important deci-
sions &ndash; not merely to respond in a reactive mode, but more in a proactive stance that considers
how best the reward system can be creatively employed to cope with the new challenges that
constantly confront a dynamic organization. Therefore, although review is the final step, it is
an ongoing process that enables management to keep on top of the situation at all times.
<p>Research into assessing reward effectiveness conducted by e-reward (2009b) found that
respondents used the following methods to measure the effectiveness of rewards:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>444 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>external market survey: 113 respondents; &bull;
<p>staff attitude survey: 99 respondents; &bull;
<p>benchmarking: 71 respondents; &bull;
<p>internal data analysis: 66 respondents; &bull;
<p>equal pay reviews: 41 respondents. &bull;
<p>As one respondent commented: &lsquo;Do it! Why would anyone spend &pound;xxm pa and not try and
understand each element&rsquo;s effectiveness (and leverage it more)?&rsquo; Another remarked: &lsquo;Build
review and continuous improvement practices into all of your reward programmes, but rec-
ognize that it is not an activity that will happen overnight. It will require a fundamental shift
in your management information and project practices.&rsquo;
<p>Evaluating reward management involves two activities, as described below: 1) conducting
regular reviews to assess the effectiveness of the existing reward system, and 2) establishing the
extent to which the objectives of a reward innovation have been achieved.
<p>Reward effectiveness reviews
<p>As recommended by Armstrong et al (2010) a reward effectiveness review requires the follow-
ing seven steps:
<p>1. Identify reward goals and success criteria.
<p>2. Research and collect both quantitative and qualitative information and evidence on exist-
ing reward policies and practices from inside the organization. This will include conduct-
ing a reward attitude survey (an example is given in Appendix A).
<p>3. Gather information on external reward practices, levels and trends; this can be used to
assess the competitiveness and distinctiveness of rewards in the organization, as well as
drawing out learning from relevant organizations externally, and from external research
on specific reward practices.
<p>4. Use this information to make assessments of the effectiveness of the delivery of reward
goals and of the various pay and reward practices.
<p>5. Determine key reward issues to address.
<p>6. Consider possible options and changes to improve the delivery of the reward goals, and
assess their strengths and weaknesses relative to the current reward practices.
<p>7. Agree the improvements required to increase effectiveness and plan their implementation.
<p>This logical sequence may look like a good structure for a review but the actual process will
depend on the circumstances and needs of the organization. As Mabey et al (1998) point out, </p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Evaluating Reward Management 445
<p>such approaches provide &lsquo;a model of management which is more rational than is achievable in
practice&rsquo;. Cultural and political factors influence perceptions and judgements, and the extent
to which people behave rationally is limited by their capacity to understand the complexities
of the situation they are in and by their emotional reactions to it &ndash; the concept of bounded
rationality as expressed by Simon (1957).
<p>However, there are three basic requirements that exist in any survey: 1) an understanding of
goals, 2) means of assessing outcomes and impacts related to those goals, and 3) a reasonably
systematic approach to interpreting the results of an assessment and drawing conclusions on
the issues involved and how they should be addressed.
<p>Reward goals
<p>Reward goals can be expressed in guiding principles (see Chapter 4) or the objectives defined
for reward initiatives. Here are some examples:
<p>Aegon UK: Motivate staff sufficiently so that they will ensure the company remains &bull;
successful, thereby allowing for continued competitive levels of reward for superior
performance.
<p>British Airways: Support a performance culture. &bull;
<p>BT: Use the full range of rewards (salary, bonus, benefits and recognition) to recruit &bull;
and retain the best people.
<p>Colt Telecom: Promote a performance culture that underpins the company business &bull;
strategy.
<p>Diageo: Support and enable the talent agenda. &bull;
<p>Financial services company: Reflect the way the organization is changing by encourag- &bull;
ing us to be more responsive to customers.
<p>Friends Provident: Facilitate a real and fundamental top-down change in corporate &bull;
culture.
<p>KPMG: Market-leading rewards for market-leading performance. &bull;
<p>Tesco: Develop a more flexible organization. &bull;
<p>These goals can be classified broadly under the four headings suggested by Corby et al (2003):
<p>Resourcing: recruitment, retention and employee turnover. &bull;
<p>Behaviour: engagement, motivation and commitment. &bull;
<p>Working practices: flexibility. &bull;
<p>Performance: productivity, profitability. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>446 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>But none of the objectives listed above sets out any specific quantitative targets against which
performance can be measured. The field work carried out by Corby et al (2003) found that
only 2 of the 15 organizations sought to evaluate the impact of their new pay system on per-
formance, and both were in the public sector. They reported that Customs &amp; Excise, when
evaluating its trial of team bonuses, measured financial performance by first establishing a
baseline for the six trial sites and three &lsquo;blind&rsquo; control sites, and then carrying out a further
review after a year. In addition, one of the trial sites carried out a customer satisfaction survey.
Partly because of the limited timescale (one year) and partly because there was &lsquo;a lot of noise
in the system&rsquo;, to quote the HR manager (ie restructuring and new appraisal and promotion
systems), the results were not conclusive. An NHS trust asked staff about the impact of the
new pay system on patient care and a small majority thought that the impact was positive.
<p>There is a reason why people don&rsquo;t set quantitative targets &ndash; it is rarely if ever possible to be
confident about the extent to which reward can impact on performance, and targets therefore
look like hostages to fortune. Post hoc measurements of the impact can also be problematic
because of the amount of work involved and the difficulty of establishing causation. Corby et
al (2003) found that managers were sceptical about the process of pay system evaluation,
holding the view that the link between a pay system and a given outcome &ndash; eg staff attitudes or
service/product delivery &ndash; was well nigh impossible to prove.
<p>Measures
<p>Ideally, the measurement of the impact of reward would compare actuals and trends with
targets, but if it is difficult to set quantified targets this is unlikely to happen. Organizations
that do assess reward practices use a wide variety of measures, as established by the CIPD 2009
reward survey and shown in Table 29.1. Resignation rates, staff surveys and performance man-
agement data are the most popular measures. Profit and productivity measures are used to a
much smaller extent in the private sector.
<p>The possible measures suggested by Armstrong et al (2010) are shown in Table 29.2.</p>

<p>Evaluating Reward Management 449
<p>Evaluating the impact of reward innovations
<p>The objectives of a reward innovation should be expressed from the outset as part of a business
case: &lsquo;This is what we propose to do.&rsquo; &lsquo;This is why we propose to do it.&rsquo; &lsquo;This is how much it
will cost.&rsquo; &lsquo;This is how the organization and its people will benefit.&rsquo; Success criteria should be
defined for each objective. These could be quantitative &ndash; eg a reduction in employee turnover,
an increase in employee engagement or reward opinion survey scores. They might often have
to be qualitative, in effect completing the statement: &lsquo;This innovation will have been successful
when&hellip; happens&rsquo;. Examples of possible objectives and associated success criteria are given in
Table 29.3 and of an engagement survey in Appendix B.
<p>A model of evaluation as a continuous process is illustrated in Figure 29.1. The final step is to
review the whole process by answering the following questions:
<p>How well have the reward changes been implemented, and to what extent are they &bull;
delivering on the reward objectives?
<p>Given what we have learnt, will any changes in design and/or process improve their &bull;
effectiveness?
<p>How are we going to review and assess their effectiveness on an ongoing basis and &bull;
perhaps in some detail after a sufficient time has elapsed to witness the full impact of
the changes?

Responsibility for Reward
<p>Learning outcomes
<p>On completing this chapter you should know about:
<p>The role of the reward professional &bull;
<p>The reward role of line managers &bull;
<p>How to use reward consultants &bull;
<p>Introduction
<p>Reward strategy is formulated and actioned by people. Top management is in charge but HR
professionals, especially reward specialists, are actively involved. Increasingly, however, it is
line managers who have the responsibility for implementing reward policies and practices.
This chapter deals with the roles of the reward professional and line managers. The chapter
concludes with a brief note on the use of management consultants.
<p>The role of the reward professional
<p>HR and reward specialists develop and implement reward strategies, policies and processes,
administer and audit existing systems, and provide advice and guidance to line managers.
They deal with employee relations issues such as involvement, communications, negotiations,
appeals and grievances.
<p>The key roles for &lsquo;high value-adding&rsquo; reward professionals as described by Brown and Christie
(2005) are:
<p>452 </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Responsibility for Reward 453
<p>keeping up with leading-edge thinking and approaches and staying ahead of the game &bull;
on environmental trends;
<p>tailoring approaches and arrangements to suit the unique goals, character and culture &bull;
of the organization, and measuring and demonstrating the value added by them, always
in the context of business and organizational knowledge and understanding;
<p>developing and applying administrative expertise to deliver highly efficient and well- &bull;
serviced reward processes;
<p>assessing and influencing the culture of the organization, with responsibility for reward &bull;
communications;
<p>operating as an integral part of the HR and business team and providing a reward strat- &bull;
egy framework that coordinates all the policies and practices designed to engage and
motivate staff to deliver the organization&rsquo;s strategy.
<p>Perhaps the most valuable contribution reward professionals make is to develop reward
arrangements that support the business strategy, working with line managers as consultants to
assist in this &ndash; as one head of reward put it to Brown and Christie: &lsquo;Shifting our culture to a
more performance-oriented business and aligning reward policies accordingly&rsquo;. Yet research
conducted by the CIPD in 2005 found that significant portions of the function&rsquo;s time are still
being absorbed in routine administrative activities and responding to immediate queries and
crises.
<p>At Citigroup the role of reward specialists is to bring parties together to facilitate and make
sustainable and effective decisions, share experiences, transfer successes and encourage a focus
on long-term sustainability and future development.
<p>The role of reward in Diageo comprises five key elements:
<p>align the reward approach with the business strategy; &bull;
<p>support and enable the talent agenda; &bull;
<p>provide clear principles to enable decision making in the business; &bull;
<p>enable every employee to understand why they get paid what they get paid; &bull;
<p>have a customer service ethic that results in great execution. &bull;
<p>Qualities required
<p>Reward specialists need the skills and expertise to design and manage complex systems that
meet the needs of users. Strategic thinking is necessary but this is not enough; service delivery
is equally important. Reward innovations can affect people deeply and they will resist or at
least resent changes that they perceive to be detrimental. It is therefore essential for reward
specialists to have change management skills.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>454 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>The 150 respondents to the 2007 e-reward census of reward professionals stated that the top
four qualities required were: 1) business awareness, 2) numeracy and analytical ability, 3)
technical reward skills and 4) influencing skills.
<p>The CIPD performance and reward profession map highlights the following competencies
required by senior reward professionals:
<p>understand the organization&rsquo;s strategy, performance goals and drivers; &bull;
<p>speak the language of the business and understand how reward can drive performance; &bull;
<p>know how to translate organization strategy into performance and reward strategies &bull;
and operating plans;
<p>consider constituent parts of the reward and recognition package for the organization, &bull;
ensuring that there is coherence in the overall offer and that it is aligned with and will
drive the organization&rsquo;s strategy and plans;
<p>manage the delivery of planned reward programmes; &bull;
<p>challenge executive leadership to adopt a performance-driven culture underpinned by &bull;
a strong performance management capability.
<p>Organization of the reward function
<p>The e-reward 2007 census found that 78 per cent of the respondents&rsquo; organizations had a
reward centre of expertise and 40 per cent had a shared service centre.
<p>The role of a reward centre of expertise is to develop and contribute to the implementation of
reward strategy, formulate reward policies, provide professional support to business policy for
corporate HR, and deal with complex issues raised by the shared service centre if one exists. Its
members act as consultants in assessing and designing reward solutions.
<p>The role of a reward shared service centre is to handle some or all day-to-day administrative
(transactional) processes. Its activities are centralized into one common unit, often using call
centre technology and/or intranet systems for online self-service.
<p>The following are three examples drawn from e-reward 2008 case studies of organizations
with centres of expertise and shared service centres:
<p>Lloyds TSB has two centres of expertise, a service delivery function and four dedicated &bull;
HR sections The head of pay policy and employee benefits is responsible for external
benchmarking, flexible benefits, pay reviews, pay reporting, total reward statements,
bonus schemes and reward communications. In addition, there are four reward busi-
ness partners for each of the main divisions.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Responsibility for Reward 455
<p>National Australia Bank Group adopts the Ulrich &lsquo;three-legged stool&rsquo; model with a &bull;
reward centre of expertise and &ndash; dealing with all HR matters, including reward &ndash; a
shared services centre and seven business partners.
<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers operates a centralized human capital shared services centre &bull;
alongside a number of centres of expertise, including one dedicated to reward. The role
of the three senior managers in the centre is to act as business partners and provide
advisory and consultancy services.
<p>Role of line managers
<p>The trend is to devolve more authority to line managers for decisions on pay increases awarded
in periodical individual pay reviews and, less commonly, fixing rates of pay on appointment
or promotion. This process reflects the general tendency to devolve more decision-making
authority to line managers on the grounds that, if managers are to be held accountable for the
management of their resources and the performance of their teams, they ought to be given
scope within guidelines to determine how their team members should be rewarded. It is also
argued that line managers are close to individual employees and are in the best position to
know how they should be valued.
<p>The arguments for devolving more authority to line managers for pay decisions are powerful
but it is still necessary to ensure that reward policies are followed, pay decisions are consistent
and fair, and pay costs are controlled. Policy guidelines as described in Chapter 28 are required
to spell out the basis upon which rates of pay are fixed and reviewed. Managers should be
expected to keep within their pay budgets.
<p>There is also the issue of the capacity of line managers to carry out their devolved role effec-
tively. As Brown and Purcell (2007) commented: &lsquo;How can your reward arrangements ever be
effective if your managers can&rsquo;t manage and communicate them?&rsquo; They described a vicious
circle of:
<p>line managers being given increasing responsibility to manage ever-more complex pay &bull;
processes, with reduced levels of HR function support;
<p>managers lacking the skills to cope with these increased demands; &bull;
<p>HR therefore not trusting line managers and restricting their discretion in these proc- &bull;
esses, which leads to managers feeling disempowered and employees not understand-
ing and trusting them either.
<p>Line managers should not be expected to make crucial pay decisions without training in the
processes involved and briefing on the policy guidelines. Reward or HR specialists have a
crucial role not only in monitoring the implementation of pay policies but also in providing </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>456 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>advice and guidance, always with the aim of developing the skills and confidence of the line
managers with whom they are involved.
<p>The major difficulties presented by devolving more responsibility to line managers are that:
<p>They may not have the knowledge or skills to carry out their responsibilities. &bull;
<p>They may be unenthusiastic about this aspect of their role, which they would see as a &bull;
diversion from their real job &ndash; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the HR department there for?&rsquo; they might say.
<p>It might be difficult to achieve acceptable standards of fairness, equity and consistency &bull;
without policing managers so closely that devolution becomes a farce.
<p>The answers to these problems are to develop clear guidelines for managers on the factors they
should take into account in making pay decisions, brief and train managers on how to inter-
pret and apply the guidelines, provide continuing but not oppressive support from HR when
required and monitor pay decisions to ensure that guidelines are being followed but, again,
not oppressively.
<p>Respondents to the 2007 e-reward survey made the following comments on the line manager&rsquo;s
role in managing contingent pay schemes:
<p>ensure managers have bought-in to the scheme and are trained and fully understand its &bull;
operation;
<p>make sure managers are willing and able to differentiate high performers from the &bull;
rest;
<p>ensure managers can also manage poor performance; &bull;
<p>make certain the messages coming from management and more senior levels are the &bull;
same and that, overall, decisions made are consistent.
<p>Using reward consultants
<p>Reward consultants are frequently engaged to help with major development projects by pro-
viding expertise and additional resources (an extra pair of hands). They can conduct diagnos-
tic reviews and employee attitude surveys, and provide disinterested advice. Effective
consultants add credibility and value because they have the knowledge of good practice and
project management that may not be available in the organization. The e-reward 2007 survey
found that 72 per cent of the respondents had employed them.
<p>To make good use of consultants it is necessary to:
<p>spell out terms of reference, deliverables and the timetable; &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Responsibility for Reward 457
<p>take great care when selecting them, to ensure that they have the expertise and experi- &bull;
ence required and will &lsquo;fit&rsquo; into the organization, and that they produce realistic and
acceptable indications of the cost of their fees and expenses;
<p>meet and vet the consultant who is going to carry out the work, not just the senior con- &bull;
sultant who presents the proposal;
<p>agree up front how they will work alongside line management, HR and trade unions, &bull;
and the basis upon which the project will be monitored and controlled;
<p>ask for regular reports and hold &lsquo;milestone&rsquo; meetings in order to review progress and &bull;
costs.
<p>It seems that reward specialists are good at applying these precepts &ndash; 97 per cent of the respond-
ents to the e-reward 2007 survey who had used consultants were satisfied with them.
<p>Line managers&rsquo; responsibility for reward: six tips
Devolve as much responsibility for reward decisions to line managers as &bull;
possible consistent with the need to ensure that reward policy guidelines are
followed and reward decisions are fair and reasonably consistent.
<p>Ensure that reward policies and guidelines are clear and unequivocal. &bull;
<p>Brief managers thoroughly on the policies and guidelines. &bull;
<p>Train newly appointed managers (and retrain existing managers as necessary) &bull;
in their reward management responsibilities.
<p>Provide guidance and help from HR or reward specialists whenever it is needed. &bull;
<p>Monitor reward decisions and advise line managers on alternative approaches &bull;
as necessary.
