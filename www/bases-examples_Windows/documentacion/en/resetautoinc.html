  Inventory number <br />
  <br />
  </strong>The inventory number is a numerical sequence managed automatically by ABCD on the holdings database. This number is defined in the database FDT as field type <strong>autoincrement</strong>. and is increased after every register is created, starting with the last value stored in the database.<br />
  <br />
  The last value stored is derived from the <strong>control_number.cn </strong>file, located in the folder <strong>data</strong> of the respective database.<br />
  <br />
  This option modifies the value of the last  number </font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">assigned</font></font><font face="Arial">, in order to restore the registers' numerical sequence.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Control number <br />
  <br />
  </strong>The control number is a mandatory field in those bibliographic databases in which copies will be managed through the holdings database, inasmuch as it represents the link field between the item and its copies. <br />
  <br />
  As in the previous case, ABCD will generate this number automatically by means of a numerical sequence. In the same way, the last number assigned is kept in the <strong>control_number.cn </strong>file, <font size="2">located in the folder <strong>data</strong> of the respective database.<br />
