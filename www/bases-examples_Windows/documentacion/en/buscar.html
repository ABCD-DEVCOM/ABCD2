<h4>Advanced Search&nbsp;</h4>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">The advanced search form is created in the <strong>Definition of Databases</strong> section and contains those fields indicated in the <strong>FST</strong> and can be used to search across the dictionary of terms.</p>
<p>To apply an advanced search execute the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the field you wish to search </li>
    <li>Click on <strong>Index</strong> to consult the dictionary of terms for the field </li>
    <li>Select the terms required for the search from the dictionary. There are two options:
    <ul>
        <li>Select the term and click on&nbsp;<strong>Search</strong> to run the search directly on the chosen term </li>
        <li>Select the term by clicking on <strong>Select term</strong> in order to transfer the term to the search form and to build a search expression that combines information from more than one field  </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If you do not wish to use the Index, type keywords in the search form&nbsp;in order to find information. To facilitate this option, indicate in the FST that the field should be searched using technique 4 (by word). If there are no results from the list of fields selected, the search will then be applied to all the fields in the database that have been indexed. </li>
    <li>If you have search expressions stored, to the right of the search expression box, an icon appears that allows you to display these expressions. Click on the icon and a window containing a menu of all the expressions previously stored will appear. Select an expression and this will transfer to the search box.<br />
    <br />
    This new way of storing search expressions can be very useful to simulate the files ANY.</font></li>
    <font face="arial" size="2"><li>Once the selection is complete, click on <img alt="" src="/central/dataentry/img/barSearch.png" /> in order to run the search on the data base and to locate the records, or on <img alt="" src="/central/dataentry/img/barDelete.png" /> in order to clear the search terms. </li>
</ol>
<p>The located records are presented in the database window in order to facilitate editing. Together with the display of the record there is a link that allows you to store search expressions.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">The stored search expressions reside in a file TXT in the folder pfts/<em>language-active </em>under the name search_expr.tab. This file can be administered across options in <strong>Update database definitions </strong>in the initial cataloguing menu.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">From the option to generate results, you are also able to store and recover search expressions previously stored.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">To add more than one previously stored search expression to the search box&nbsp;link these together with the boolean operator AND</font></p>
