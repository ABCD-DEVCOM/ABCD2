<P>ABCD uses two types of components for bilingual treatment:</P>
<P><STRONG>Messages and tags</STRONG></P>
<P>Contains a table of the tags used for communication with the user, as
well as the warning messages, error messages, and others used for communication with the user.</P>
<P>These tables are stored in the folders <STRONG>bases/lang/xx</STRONG>
where<STRONG> xx</STRONG> corresponds to the language code.
In addition the language code <STRONG>00 </STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">has
been created, and corresponds to a table with the messages used
during the execution of the processes. When a communication language is
selected, the first thing to read is the table of the selected language,
and then the table of the language </SPAN></STRONG><STRONG>00</STRONG>
to complete the messages that are not described in the selected
language. This way, the modules can generate new messages without
modifying the tables with messages updated by the users, and without
showing that there is a lack of messages during the execution of the processes.</P>
<P>When you request the modification of a table of messages in a particular
language, this will be complemented with the table in the
language <STRONG>00</STRONG> to allow the user to translate the new
messages incorporated in ABCD.</P>
<P><STRONG>Help pages</STRONG></P>
<P>This option allows the user to translate the help pages that exist in the
different modules of ABCD. To facilitate the translation a list of
the pages displayed in each module is presented, and the user can
choose:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To present a previous view of the
	corresponding page</P>
	<LI><P>To edit the help page</P>
</UL>
