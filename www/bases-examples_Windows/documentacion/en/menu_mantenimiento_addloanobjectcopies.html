<p><strong>Function to Add copies to Loanobjects from the catalogue database<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Using this functionality the user can send in a batch all the copies from the records in the catalogue to the loanobjects database.<br />
You can select to import the fields from your catalog that match to the ABCD loanobjects database just selecting the desire field from the list. If you wish to remove one of the fields just select it from the list and click on the delete button (X). The loanobjects records will be added to the ones you already have.</p>
<p>You can select to use the system types to add to loanobject your copies or to use a field in your catalogue copies. Be aware that if you select to use information stored in your catalogue copies the system may not recognize them and you will have to add this type of items manually.</p>
<p>If the user writes down a string in the “from” and “to” fields the system will warn him about the necessity of setting the ranges as numerical values. If the user still does not change the values then the script will end with a warning message informing the user that the process could not be executed.</p>
<p>While filling the fields is a good practice to provide the v before each field tag. If the user forgets to add this information the system adds it by default. The same principle applies to the subfields in the way of providing the ^ symbol before the subfield index.</p>
<p>The database will be automatically unlink to the copies database.</p>
