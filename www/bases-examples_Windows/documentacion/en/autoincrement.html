</strong>This option enables the automatic assignment of a sequential number to the database records.<br />
<br />
In the FDT the control field is defined&nbsp;as field type "Autoincrement". In the definition of the field the code which must be included is indicated in the inverted list and the corresponding display and extraction formats.<br />
<br />
The number is taken from the file <strong>control_number.cn</strong> stored in the folder <strong>data</strong> from the corresponding data base. The last number assigned to a record is stored in this file.</p>
<p>The information in the control number field cannot be inserted directly, the record number is allocated by one of the following methods :</p>
<ol>
    <li>If the target field is left blank at the time of saving the record, the next number will be assigned and recorded in the corresponding field</li>
    <li>If you wish to assign a control number directly follow this procedure:
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the link <strong>To assign</strong> next to the text box for the control number field.</li>
        <li>A new window opens which allows the control number to be assigned</li>
        <li>Click on <strong>Send</strong> to validate whether a control number exists or not.</li>
        <li>If the validation is successful (i.e. the control number does not exist), the value is assigned to the entry form</li>
        <li>If the validation is not successful (i.e. the control number exists) the record confirms that it is already assigned. Click on <strong>Return</strong> to assign another number or <strong>Close</strong> to close the window</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In order to erase the control number, click on <strong>Assign</strong> this leaves the control number in target, thereafter click on <strong>Send</strong></li>
</ol>
